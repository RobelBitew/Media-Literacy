Introduction
Dedicated to the Lenin Enrollment1
J.V. Stalin
The foundations of Leninism is a big subject. To exhaust it a whole
volume would be required. Indeed, a number of volumes would be
required. Naturally, therefore, my lectures cannot be an exhaustive exposition of Leninism; at best they can only offer a concise synopsis of the
foundations of Leninism. Nevertheless, I consider it useful to give this
synopsis, in order to lay down some basic points of departure necessary for
the successful study of Leninism.
Expounding the foundations of Leninism still does not mean
expounding the basis of Lenin’s world outlook. Lenin’s world outlook and
the foundations of Leninism are not identical in scope. Lenin was a Marxist, and Marxism is, of course, the basis of his world outlook. But from
this it does not at all follow that an exposition of Leninism ought to begin
with an exposition of the foundations of Marxism. To expound Leninism
means to expound the distinctive and new in the works of Lenin that
Lenin contributed to the general treasury of Marxism and that is naturally
connected with his name. Only in this sense will I speak in my lectures of
the foundations of Leninism.
And so, what is Leninism?
Some say that Leninism is the application of Marxism to the conditions that are peculiar to the situation in Russia. This definition contains
a particle of truth, but not the whole truth by any means. Lenin, indeed,
applied Marxism to Russian conditions, and applied it in a masterly way.
But if Leninism were only the application of Marxism to the conditions
that are peculiar to Russia it would be a purely national and only a national,
a purely Russian and only a Russian, phenomenon. We know, however,
that Leninism is not merely a Russian, but an international phenomenon
1. J. V. Stalin’s lectures, The Foundations of Leninism, were published in Pravda in April
and May 1924. In May 1924, J. V. Stalin’s pamphlet On Lenin and Leninism appeared,
containing the reminiscences on Lenin and the lectures The Foundations of Leninism. J.
V. Stalin’s work The Foundations of Leninism is included in all the editions of his book
Problems of Leninism.

rooted in the whole of international development. That is why I think this
definition suffers from one-sidedness.
Others say that Leninism is the revival of the revolutionary elements
of Marxism of the forties of the nineteenth century, as distinct from the
Marxism of subsequent years, when, it is alleged, it became moderate,
non-revolutionary. If we disregard this foolish and vulgar division of the
teachings of Marx into two parts, revolutionary and moderate, we must
admit that even this totally inadequate and unsatisfactory definition contains a particle of truth. This particle of truth is that Lenin did indeed
restore the revolutionary content of Marxism, which had been suppressed
by the opportunists of the Second International. Still, that is but a particle
of the truth. The whole truth about Leninism is that Leninism not only
restored Marxism, but also took a step forward, developing Marxism further under the new conditions of capitalism and of the class struggle of the
proletariat.
What, then, in the last analysis, is Leninism?
Leninism is Marxism of the era of imperialism and the proletarian
revolution. To be more exact, Leninism is the theory and tactics of the
proletarian revolution in general, the theory and tactics of the dictatorship
of the proletariat in particular. Marx and Engels pursued their activities in
the pre-revolutionary period (we have the proletarian revolution in mind),
when developed imperialism did not yet exist, in the period of the proletarians’ preparation for revolution, in the period when the proletarian
revolution was not yet an immediate practical inevitability. But Lenin, the
disciple of Marx and Engels, pursued his activities in the period of developed imperialism, in the period of the unfolding proletarian revolution,
when the proletarian revolution had already triumphed in one country,
had smashed bourgeois democracy and had ushered in the era of proletarian democracy, the era of the Soviets.
That is why Leninism is the further development of Marxism.
It is usual to point to the exceptionally militant and exceptionally
revolutionary character of Leninism. This is quite correct. But this specific
feature of Leninism is due to two causes: firstly, to the fact that Leninism
emerged from the proletarian revolution, the imprint of which it cannot
but bear; secondly, to the fact that it grew and became strong in clashes
with the opportunism of the Second International, the fight against which
2

Introduction

was and remains an essential preliminary condition for a successful fight
against capitalism. It must not be forgotten that between Marx and Engels,
on the one hand, and Lenin, on the other, there lies a whole period of
undivided domination of the opportunism of the Second International,
and the ruthless struggle against this opportunism could not but constitute one of the most important tasks of Leninism.

1. The Historical Roots of Leninism

Chapter I.

The Historical Roots of Leninism
Leninism grew up and took shape under the conditions of imperialism, when the contradictions of capitalism had reached an extreme point,
when the proletarian revolution had become an immediate practical question, when the old period of preparation of the working class for revolution had arrived at and passed into a new period, that of direct assault on
capitalism.
Lenin called imperialism “moribund capitalism.” Why? Because
imperialism carries the contradictions of capitalism to their last bounds,
to the extreme limit, beyond which revolution begins. Of these contradictions, there are three which must be regarded as the most important.
The first contradiction is the contradiction between labour and capital. Imperialism is the omnipotence of the monopolist trusts and syndicates, of the banks and the financial oligarchy, in the industrial countries. In the fight against this omnipotence, the customary methods of the
working class-trade unions and cooperatives, parliamentary parties and the
parliamentary struggle—have proved to be totally inadequate. Either place
yourself at the mercy of capital, eke out a wretched existence as of old and
sink lower and lower, or adopt a new weapon—this is the alternative imperialism puts before the vast masses of the proletariat. Imperialism brings
the working class to revolution.
The second contradiction is the contradiction among the various
financial groups and imperialist Powers in their struggle for sources of raw
materials, for foreign territory. Imperialism is the export of capital to the
sources of raw materials, the frenzied struggle for monopolist possession
of these sources, the struggle for a re-division of the already divided world,
a struggle waged with particular fury by new financial groups and Powers
seeking a “place in the sun” against the old groups and Powers, which cling
tenaciously to what they have seized. This frenzied struggle among the various groups of capitalists is notable in that it includes as an inevitable element imperialist wars, wars for the annexation of foreign territories. This
circumstance, in its turn, is notable in that it leads to the mutual weaken5

The Foundations of Leninism

ing of the imperialists, to the weakening of the position of capitalism in
general, to the acceleration of the advent of the proletarian revolution and
to the practical necessity of this revolution.
The third contradiction is the contradiction between the handful of
ruling, “civilised” nations and the hundreds of millions of the colonial
and dependent peoples of the world. Imperialism is the most barefaced
exploitation and the most inhuman oppression of hundreds of millions of
people inhabiting vast colonies and dependent countries. The purpose of
this exploitation and of this oppression is to squeeze out super-profits. But
in exploiting these countries imperialism is compelled to build their railways, factories and mills, industrial and commercial centers. The appearance of a class of proletarians, the emergence of a native intelligentsia, the
awakening of national consciousness, the growth of the liberation movement—such are the inevitable results of this “policy.” The growth of the
revolutionary movement in all colonies and dependent countries without
exception clearly testifies to this fact. This circumstance is of importance
for the proletariat inasmuch as it saps radically the position of capitalism
by converting the colonies and dependent countries from reserves of imperialism into reserves of the proletarian revolution.
Such, in general, are the principal contradictions of imperialism
which have converted the old, “flourishing” capitalism into moribund
capitalism.
The significance of the imperialist war which broke out ten years ago
lies, among other things, in the fact that it gathered all these contradictions
into a single knot and threw them on to the scales, thereby accelerating
and facilitating the revolutionary battles of the proletariat.
In other words, imperialism was instrumental not only in making
the revolution a practical inevitability, but also in creating favourable conditions for a direct assault on the citadels of capitalism.
Such was the international situation which gave birth to Leninism.
Some may say: this is all very well, but what has it to do with Russia,
which was not and could not be a classical land of imperialism? What has
it to do with Lenin, who worked primarily in Russia and for Russia? Why
did Russia, of all countries, become the home of Leninism, the birthplace
of the theory and tactics of the proletarian revolution?
Because Russia was the focus of all these contradictions of imperi6

1. The Historical Roots of Leninism

alism.

Because Russia, more than any other country, was pregnant with
revolution, and she alone, therefore, was in a position to solve those contradictions in a revolutionary way.
To begin with, tsarist Russia was the home of every kind of oppression—capitalist, colonial and militarist—in its most inhuman and barbarous form. Who does not know that in Russia the omnipotence of capital
was combined with the despotism of tsarism, the aggressiveness of Russian
nationalism with tsarism’s role of executioner in regard to the non-Russian
peoples, the exploitation of entire regions—Turkey, Persia, China—with
the seizure of these regions by tsarism, with wars of conquest? Lenin was
right in saying that tsarism was “military-feudal imperialism.” Tsarism was
the concentration of the worst features of imperialism, raised to a high
pitch.
To proceed. Tsarist Russia was a major reserve of Western imperialism, not only in the sense that it gave free entry to foreign capital, which
controlled such basic branches of Russia’s national economy as the fuel and
metallurgical industries, but also in the sense that it could supply the Western imperialists with millions of soldiers. Remember the Russian army,
fourteen million strong, which shed its blood on the imperialist fronts to
safeguard the staggering profits of the British and French capitalists.
Further. Tsarism was not only the watchdog of imperialism in the
east of Europe, but, in addition, it was the agent of Western imperialism
for squeezing out of the population hundreds of millions by way of interest
on loans obtained in Paris and London, Berlin and Brussels.
Finally, tsarism was a most faithful ally of Western imperialism in
the partition of Turkey, Persia, China, etc. Who does not know that the
imperialist war was waged by tsarism in alliance with the imperialists of the
Entente, and that Russia was an essential element in that war?
That is why the interests of tsarism and of Western imperialism were
interwoven and ultimately became merged in a single skein of imperialist
interests.
Could Western imperialism resign itself to the loss of such a powerful
support in the East and of such a rich reservoir of manpower and resources
as old, tsarist, bourgeois Russia was without exerting all its strength to
wage a life-and-death struggle against the revolution in Russia, with the
7

The Foundations of Leninism

object of defending and preserving tsarism? Of course not.
But from this it follows that whoever wanted to strike at tsarism
necessarily raised his hand against imperialism, whoever rose against tsarism had to rise against imperialism as well; for whoever was bent on overthrowing tsarism had to overthrow imperialism too, if he really intended
not merely to defeat tsarism, but to make a clean sweep of it. Thus the revolution against tsarism verged on and had to pass into a revolution against
imperialism, into a proletarian revolution.
Meanwhile, in Russia a tremendous popular revolution was rising,
headed by the most revolutionary proletariat in the world, which possessed
such an important ally as the revolutionary peasantry of Russia. Does it
need proof that such a revolution could not stop halfway, that in the event
of success it was bound to advance further and raise the banner of revolt
against imperialism?
That is why Russia was bound to become the focus of the contradictions of imperialism, not only in the sense that it was in Russia that
these contradictions were revealed most plainly, in view of their particularly repulsive and particularly intolerable character, and not only because
Russia was a highly important prop of Western imperialism, connecting
Western finance capital with the colonies in the East, but also because
Russia was the only country in which there existed a real force capable of
resolving the contradictions of imperialism in a revolutionary way.
From this it follows, however, that the revolution in Russia could
not but become a proletarian revolution, that from its very inception it
could not but assume an international character, and that, therefore, it
could not but shake the very foundations of world imperialism.
Under these circumstances, could the Russian Communists confine
their work within the narrow national bounds of the Russian revolution?
Of course not. On the contrary, the whole situation, both internal (the
profound revolutionary crisis) and external (the war), impelled them to go
beyond these bounds in their work, to transfer the struggle to the international arena, to expose the ulcers of imperialism, to prove that the collapse
of capitalism was inevitable, to smash social-chauvinism and social-pacifism, and, finally, to overthrow capitalism in their own country and to
forge a new fighting weapon for the proletariat—the theory and tactics
of the proletarian revolution—in order to facilitate the task of overthrow8

1. The Historical Roots of Leninism

ing capitalism for the proletarians of all countries. Nor could the Russian
Communists act otherwise, for only this path offered the chance of producing certain changes in the international situation which could safeguard Russia against the restoration of the bourgeois order.
That is why Russia became the home of Leninism, and why Lenin,
the leader of the Russian Communists, became its creator.
The same thing, approximately, “happened” in the case of Russia
and Lenin as in the case of Germany and Marx and Engels in the forties
of the last century. Germany at that time was pregnant with bourgeois
revolution just like Russia at the beginning of the twentieth century. Marx
wrote at that time in the Communist Manifesto:
“The Communists turn their attention chiefly to Germany, because that country is on the eve of a bourgeois revolution that is bound to be carried out under more advanced
conditions of European civilisation, and with a much more
developed proletariat, than that of England was in the seventeenth, and of France in the eighteenth century, and because
the bourgeois revolution in Germany will be but the prelude
to an immediately following proletarian revolution.”2
In other words, the centre of the revolutionary movement was shifting to Germany.
There can hardly be any doubt that it was this very circumstance,
noted by Marx in the above-quoted passage, that served as the probable
reason why it was precisely Germany that became the birthplace of scientific socialism and why the leaders of the German proletariat, Marx and
Engels, became its creators.
The same, only to a still greater degree, must be said of Russia at
the beginning of the twentieth century. Russia was then on the eve of a
bourgeois revolution; she had to accomplish this revolution at a time when
conditions in Europe were more advanced, and with a proletariat that was
more developed than that of Germany in the forties of the nineteenth

century (let alone Britain and France); moreover, all the evidence went to
show that this revolution was bound to serve as a ferment and as a prelude
to the proletarian revolution. We cannot regard it as accidental that as
early as 1902, when the Russian revolution was still in an embryonic state,
Lenin wrote the prophetic words in his pamphlet What Is To Be Done?:
“History has now confronted us (i.e., the Russian Marxists-J. St.) with an immediate task which is the most revolutionary of all the immediate tasks that confront the proletariat
of any country. The fulfilment of this task, the destruction of
the most powerful bulwark, not only of European, but also (it
may now be said) of Asiatic reaction, would make the Russian
proletariat the vanguard of the international revolutionary
proletariat.” (See Vol. IV, p. 382.)3
In other words, the centre of the revolutionary movement was
bound to shift to Russia.
As we know, the course of the revolution in Russia has more than
vindicated Lenin’s prediction.
Is it surprising, after all this, that a country which has accomplished
such a revolution and possesses such a proletariat should have been the
birthplace of the theory and tactics of the proletarian revolution?
Is it surprising that Lenin, the leader of Russia’s proletariat, became
also the creator of this theory and tactics and the leader of the international
proletariat?

2. Method

Chapter II.

Method
I have already said that between Marx and Engels, on the one hand,
and Lenin, on the other, there lies a whole period of domination of the
opportunism of the Second International. For the sake of exactitude I must
add that it is not the formal domination of opportunism I have in mind,
but only its actual domination. Formally, the Second International was
headed by “faithful” Marxists, by the “orthodox”—Kautsky and others.
Actually, however, the main work of the Second International followed the
line of opportunism. The opportunists adapted themselves to the bourgeoisie because of their adaptive, petty-bourgeois nature; the “orthodox,”
in their turn, adapted themselves to the opportunists in order to “preserve
unity” with them, in the interests of “peace within the party.” Thus the link
between the policy of the bourgeoisie and the policy of the “orthodox” was
closed, and, as a result, opportunism reigned supreme.
This was the period of the relatively peaceful development of capitalism, the pre-war period, so to speak, when the catastrophic contradictions
of imperialism had not yet become so glaringly evident, when workers’ economic strikes and trade unions were developing more or less “normally,”
when election campaigns and parliamentary groups yielded “dizzying”
successes, when legal forms of struggle were lauded to the skies, and when
it was thought that capitalism would be “killed” by legal means—in short,
when the parties of the Second International were living in clover and had
no inclination to think seriously about revolution, about the dictatorship
of the proletariat, about the revolutionary education of the masses.
Instead of an integral revolutionary theory, there were contradictory
theoretical postulates and fragments of theory, which were divorced from
the actual revolutionary struggle of the masses and had been turned into
threadbare dogmas. For the sake of appearances, Marx’s theory was mentioned, of course, but only to rob it of its living, revolutionary spirit.
Instead of a revolutionary policy, there was flabby philistinism and
sordid political bargaining, parliamentary diplomacy and parliamentary
scheming. For the sake of appearances, of course, “revolutionary” resolu11

The Foundations of Leninism

tions and slogans were adopted, but only to be pigeonholed.
Instead of the party being trained and taught correct revolutionary
tactics on the basis of its own mistakes, there was a studied evasion of vexed
questions, which were glossed over and veiled. For the sake of appearances,
of course, there was no objection to talking about vexed questions, but
only in order to wind up with some sort of “elastic” resolution.
Such was the physiognomy of the Second International, its method
of work, its arsenal.
Meanwhile, a new period of imperialist wars and of revolutionary
battles of the proletariat was approaching. The old methods of fighting
were proving obviously inadequate and impotent in the face of the omnipotence of finance capital.
It became necessary to overhaul the entire activity of the Second
International, its entire method of work, and to drive out all philistinism,
narrow-mindedness, political scheming, renegacy, social-chauvinism and
social-pacifism. It became necessary to examine the entire arsenal of the
Second International, to throw out all that was rusty and antiquated, to
forge new weapons. Without this preliminary work it was useless embarking upon war against capitalism. Without this work the proletariat ran the
risk of finding itself inadequately armed, or even completely unarmed, in
the future revolutionary battles.
The honour of bringing about this general overhauling and general
cleansing of the Augean stables of the Second International fell to Leninism.
Such were the conditions under which the method of Leninism was
born and hammered out.
What are the requirements of this method?
Firstly, the testing of the theoretical dogmas of the Second International in the crucible of the revolutionary struggle of the masses, in the
crucible of living practice—that is to say, the restoration of the broken
unity between theory and practice, the healing of the rift between them;
for only in this way can a truly proletarian party armed with revolutionary
theory be created.
Secondly, the testing of the policy of the parties of the Second International, not by their slogans and resolutions (which cannot be trusted),
but by their deeds, by their actions; for only in this way can the confidence
12

2. Method

of the proletarian masses be won and deserved.
Thirdly, the reorganisation of all Party work on new revolutionary
lines, with a view to training and preparing the masses for the revolutionary struggle; for only in this way can the masses be prepared for the
proletarian revolution.
Fourthly, self-criticism within the proletarian parties, their education
and training on the basis of their own mistakes; for only in this way can
genuine cadres and genuine leaders of the Party be trained.
Such is the basis and substance of the method of Leninism.
How was this method applied in practice?
The opportunists of the Second International have a number of theoretical dogmas to which they always revert as their starting point. Let us
take a few of these.
First dogma: concerning the conditions for the seizure of power by
the proletariat. The opportunists assert that the proletariat cannot and
ought not to take power unless it constitutes a majority in the country. No
proofs are brought forward, for there are no proofs, either theoretical or
practical, that can bear out this absurd thesis. Let us assume that this is so,
Lenin replies to the gentlemen of the Second International; but suppose a
historical situation has arisen (a war, an agrarian crisis, etc.) in which the
proletariat, constituting a minority of the population, has an opportunity
to rally around itself the vast majority of the labouring masses; why should
it not take power then? Why should the proletariat not take advantage of a
favourable international and internal situation to pierce the front of capital
and hasten the general denouement? Did not Marx say as far back as the
fifties of the last century that things could go “splendidly” with the proletarian revolution in Germany were it possible to back it by, so to speak, a
“second edition of the Peasants’ War”?4 Is it not a generally known fact that
in those days the number of proletarians in Germany was relatively smaller
than, for example, in Russia in 1917? Has not the practical experience of
the Russian proletarian revolution shown that this favourite dogma of the
heroes of the Second International is devoid of all vital significance for the
proletariat? Is it not clear that the practical experience of the revolutionary
4. This refers to the statement by Karl Marx in his letter to Frederick Engels of April 16,
1856 (Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, Selected Works, Moscow, 195 1, Vol. II, p. 412).

13

The Foundations of Leninism

struggle of the masses refutes and smashes this obsolete dogma?
Second dogma: the proletariat cannot retain power if it lacks an
adequate number of trained cultural and administrative cadres capable of
organising the administration of the country; these cadres must first be
trained under capitalist conditions, and only then can power be taken.
Let us assume that this is so, replies Lenin; but why not turn it this way:
first take power, create favourable conditions for the development of the
proletariat, and then proceed with seven-league strides to raise the cultural level of the labouring masses and train numerous cadres of leaders
and administrators from among the workers? Has not Russian experience
shown that the cadres of leaders recruited from the ranks of the workers
develop a hundred times more rapidly and effectually under the rule of the
proletariat than under the rule of capital? Is it not clear that the practical
experience of the revolutionary struggle of the masses ruthlessly smashes
this theoretical dogma of the opportunists too?
Third dogma: the proletariat cannot accept the method of the political general strike because it is unsound in theory (see Engels’s criticism)
and dangerous in practice (it may disturb the normal course of economic
life in the country, it may deplete the coffers of the trade unions), and cannot serve as a substitute for parliamentary forms of struggle, which are the
principal form of the class struggle of the proletariat. Very well, reply the
Leninists; but, firstly, Engels did not criticise every kind of general strike.
He only criticised a certain kind of general strike, namely, the economic
general strike advocated by the Anarchists 5in place of the political struggle
of the proletariat. What has this to do with the method of the political general strike? Secondly, where and by whom has it ever been proved that the
parliamentary form of struggle is the principal form of struggle of the proletariat? Does not the history of the revolutionary movement show that the
parliamentary struggle is only a school for, and an auxiliary in, organising
the extra-parliamentary struggle of the proletariat, that under capitalism
the fundamental problems of the working-class movement are solved by
force, by the direct struggle of the proletarian masses, their general strike,
their uprising? Thirdly, who suggested that the method of the political
5. This refers to Frederick Engels’s article “The Bakuninists at Work” (see Frederick
Engels, “Die Bakunisten an der Arbeit” in Der Volksstaat, Nos. 105, 106 and 107, 1873).

14

2. Method

general strike be substituted for the parliamentary struggle? Where and
when have the supporters of the political general strike sought to substitute extra-parliamentary forms of struggle for parliamentary forms?
Fourthly, has not the revolution in Russia shown that the political general
strike is a highly important school for the proletarian revolution and an
indispensable means of mobilising and organising the vast masses of the
proletariat on the eve of storming the citadels of capitalism? Why then
the philistine lamentations over the disturbance of the normal course of
economic life and over the coffers of the trade unions? Is it not clear that
the practical experience of the revolutionary struggle smashes this dogma
of the opportunists too?
And so on and so forth.
That is why Lenin said that “revolutionary theory is not a dogma,”
that it “assumes final shape only in close connection with the practical
activity of a truly mass and truly revolutionary movement” (“Left-Wing”
Communism)6; for theory must serve practice, for “theory must answer the
questions raised by practice” (What the “Friends of the People” Are)7, for it
must be tested by practical results.
As to the political slogans and the political resolutions of the parties of the Second International, it is sufficient to recall the history of the
slogan “war against war” to realise how utterly false and utterly rotten
are the political practices of these parties, which use pompous revolutionary slogans and resolutions to cloak their anti-revolutionary deeds. We all
remember the pompous demonstration of the Second International at the
Basle Congress8, at which it threatened the imperialist with all the horrors
of insurrection if they should dare to start a war, and with the menacing

8. The Basle Congress of the Second International was held on November 24-25, 1912.
It was convened in connection with the Balkan War and the impending threat of a world
war. Only one question was discussed: the international situation and joint action against
war. The congress adopted a manifesto calling upon the workers to utilise their proletarian organisation and might to wage a revolutionary struggle against the danger of war, to
declare “war against war.”

15

The Foundations of Leninism

slogan “war against war.” But who does not remember that some time
after, on the very eve of the war, the Basle resolution was pigeonholed
and the workers were given a new slogan—to exterminate each other for
the glory of their capitalist fatherlands? Is it not clear that revolutionary
slogans and resolutions are not worth a farthing unless backed by deeds?
One need only contrast the Leninist policy of transforming the imperialist
war into civil war with the treacherous policy of the Second International
during the war to understand the utter baseness of the opportunist politicians and the full grandeur of the method of Leninism.
I cannot refrain from quoting at this point a passage from Lenin’s
book The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky, in which Lenin
severely castigates an opportunist attempt by the leader of the Second
International, K. Kautsky, to judge parties not by their deeds, but by their
paper slogans and documents:
“Kautsky is pursuing a typically petty-bourgeois, philistine policy by pretending... that putting forward a slogan alters
the position. The entire history of bourgeois democracy refutes
this illusion; the bourgeois democrats have always advanced
and still advance all sorts of ‘slogans’ in order to deceive the
people. The point is to test their sincerity, to compare their
words with their deeds, not to be satisfied with idealistic or
charlatan phrases, but to get down to class reality.” (See Vol.
XXIII, p. 377.)
There is no need to mention the fear the parties of the Second International have of self-criticism, their habit of concealing their mistakes,
of glossing over vexed questions, of covering up their shortcomings by a
deceptive show of well-being which blunts living thought and prevents the
Party from deriving revolutionary training from its own mistakes—a habit
which was ridiculed and pilloried by Lenin. Here is what Lenin wrote
about self-criticism in proletarian parties in his pamphlet “Left-Wing”
Communism:
“The attitude of a political party towards its own mistakes is one of the most important and surest ways of judging
16

2. Method

how earnest the party is and how it in practice fulfils its obligations towards its class and the toiling masses. Frankly admitting a mistake, ascertaining the reasons for it, analysing the
circumstances which gave rise to it, and thoroughly discussing
the means of correcting it—that is the earmark of a serious
party; that is the way it should perform its duties, that is the
way it should educate and train the class, and then the masses.”
(See Vol. XXV, p. 200.)
Some say that the exposure of its own mistakes and self-criticism are
dangerous for the Party because they may be used by the enemy against
the party of the proletariat. Lenin regarded such objections as trivial and
entirely wrong. Here is what he wrote on this subject as far back as 1904,
in his pamphlet One Step Forward, when our Party was still weak and
small:
“They (i.e., the opponents of the Marxists-J. St.) gloat
and grimace over our controversies; and, of course, they will
try to pick isolated passages from my pamphlet, which deals
with the defects and shortcomings of our Party, and to use
them for their own ends. The Russian Social-Democrats are
already steeled enough in battle not to be perturbed by these
pinpricks and to continue, in spite of them, their work of
self-criticism and ruthless exposure of their own shortcomings, which will unquestionably and inevitably be overcome
as the working-class movement grows.” (See Vol. VI, p. 161.)
Such, in general, are the characteristic features of the method of
Leninism.
What is contained in Lenin’s method was in the main already contained in the teachings of Marx, which, according to Marx himself, were
“in essence critical and revolutionary.”9 It is precisely this critical and revolutionary spirit that pervades Lenin’s method from beginning to end. But
it would be wrong to suppose that Lenin’s method is merely the restoration

(Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, Selected Works, Moscow, 1951, Vol. I, p. 414).

of the method of Marx. As a matter of fact, Lenin’s method is not only the
restoration, but also the concretisation and further development of the
critical and revolutionary method of Marx, of his materialist dialectics.

3. Theory

Chapter III.

Theory
From this theme I take three questions:
a)  the importance of theory for the proletarian movement;
b)  criticism of the “theory” of spontaneity;
c)  the theory of the proletarian revolution.
1) The importance of theory. Some think that Leninism is the precedence of practice over theory in the sense that its main point is the translation of the Marxist theses into deeds, their “execution”; as for theory,
it is alleged that Leninism is rather unconcerned about it. We know that
Plekhanov time and again chaffed Lenin about his “unconcern” for theory,
and particularly for philosophy. We also know that theory is not held in
great favour by many present-day Leninist practical workers, particularly
in view of the immense amount of practical work imposed upon them by
the situation. I must declare that this more than odd opinion about Lenin
and Leninism is quite wrong and bears no relation whatever to the truth;
that the attempt of practical workers to brush theory aside runs counter
to the whole spirit of Leninism and is fraught with serious dangers to the
work.
Theory is the experience of the working-class movement in all countries taken in its general aspect. Of course, theory becomes purposeless if
it is not connected with revolutionary practice, just as practice gropes in
the dark if its path is not illumined by revolutionary theory. But theory
can become a tremendous force in the working-class movement if it is
built up in indissoluble connection with revolutionary practice; for theory,
and theory alone, can give the movement confidence, the power of orientation, and an understanding of the inner relation of surrounding events;
for it, and it alone, can help practice to realise not only how and in which
direction classes are moving at the present time, but also how and in which
direction they will move in the near future. None other than Lenin uttered
and repeated scores of times the well-known thesis that:
“Without a revolutionary theory there can be no revolu19

tionary movement.”10 (See Vol. IV, p. 380.)
Lenin, better than anyone else, understood the great importance of
theory, particularly for a party such as ours, in view of the role of vanguard
fighter of the international proletariat which has fallen to its lot, and in
view of the complicated internal and international situation in which it
finds itself. Foreseeing this special role of our Party as far back as 1902, he
thought it necessary even then to point out that:
“The role of vanguard fighter can be fulfilled only by a
party that is guided by the most advanced theory.” (See Vol. IV,
p. 380.)
It scarcely needs proof that now, when Lenin’s prediction about the
role of our Party has come true, this thesis of Lenin’s acquires special force
and special importance.
Perhaps the most striking expression of the great importance which
Lenin attached to theory is the fact that none other than Lenin undertook
the very serious task of generalising, on the basis of materialist philosophy,
the most important achievements of science from the time of Engels down
to his own time, as well as of subjecting to comprehensive criticism the
anti-materialistic trends among Marxists. Engels said that materialism has
to change its form with each epoch-making discovery.11 It is well known
that none other than Lenin accomplished this task for his own time in his
remarkable work Materialism and Empirio-Criticism.12 It is well known
that Plekhanov, who loved to chaff Lenin about his “unconcern” for philosophy, did not even dare to make a serious attempt to undertake such a
task.
2) Criticism of the “theory” of spontaneity, or the role of the vanguard
in the movement. The “theory” of spontaneity is a theory of opportunism,
a theory of worshipping the spontaneity of the labour movement, a theory

3. Theory

which actually repudiates the leading role of the vanguard of the working
class, of the party of the working class.
The theory of worshipping spontaneity is decidedly opposed to the
revolutionary character of the working class movement; it is opposed to
the movement taking the line of struggle against the foundations of capitalism; it is in favour of the movement proceeding exclusively along the
line of “realisable” demands, of demands “acceptable” to capitalism; it is
wholly in favour of the “line of least resistance.” The theory of spontaneity
is the ideology of trade unionism.
The theory of worshipping spontaneity is decidedly opposed to giving the spontaneous movement a politically conscious, planned character.
It is opposed to the Party marching at the head of the working class, to the
Party raising the masses to the level of political consciousness, to the Party
leading the movement; it is in favour of the politically conscious elements
of the movement not hindering the movement from taking its own course;
it is in favour of the Party only heeding the spontaneous movement and
dragging at the tail of it. The theory of spontaneity is the theory of belittling the role of the conscious element in the movement, the ideology of
“khvostism,” the logical basis of all opportunism.
In practice this theory, which appeared on the scene even before the
first revolution in Russia, led its adherents, the so-called “Economists,” to
deny the need for an independent workers’ party in Russia, to oppose the
revolutionary struggle of the working class for the overthrow of tsarism,
to preach a purely trade-unionist policy in the movement, and, in general,
to surrender the labour movement to the hegemony of the liberal bourgeoisie.
The fight of the old Iskra and the brilliant criticism of the theory of
“khvostism” in Lenin’s pamphlet What Is To Be Done? not only smashed
so-called “Economism,” but also created the theoretical foundations for a
truly revolutionary movement of the Russian working class.
Without this fight it would have been quite useless even to think
of creating an independent workers’ party in Russia and of its playing a
leading part in the revolution.
But the theory of worshipping spontaneity is not an exclusively
Russian phenomenon. It is extremely widespread—in a somewhat different form, it is true—in all the parties of the Second International, with21

The Foundations of Leninism

out exception. I have in mind the so-called “productive forces” theory as
debased by the leaders of the Second International, which justifies everything and conciliates everybody, which records facts and explains them
after everyone has become sick and tired of them, and, having recorded
them, rests content. Marx said that the materialist theory could not confine itself to explaining the world, that it must also change it.13 But Kautsky
and Co. are not concerned with this; they prefer to rest content with the
first part of Marx’s formula.
Here is one of the numerous examples of the application of this
“theory.” It is said that before the imperialist war the parties of the Second
International threatened to declare “war against war” if the imperialists
should start a war. It is said that on the very eve of the war these parties pigeonholed the “war against war” slogan and applied an opposite
one, viz., “war for the imperialist fatherland.” It is said that as a result of
this change of slogans millions of workers were sent to their death. But
it would be a mistake to think that there were some people to blame for
this, that someone was unfaithful to the working class or betrayed it. Not
at all! Everything happened as it should have happened. Firstly, because
the International, it seems, is “an instrument of peace,” and not of war.
Secondly, because, in view of the “level of the productive forces” which
then prevailed, nothing else could be done. The “productive forces” are “to
blame.” That is the precise explanation vouchsafed to “us” by Mr. Kautsky’s
“theory of the productive forces.” And whoever does not believe in that
“theory” is not a Marxist. The role of the parties? Their importance for
the movement? But what can a party do against so decisive a factor as the
“level of the productive forces”?...
One could cite a host of similar examples of the falsification of
Marxism.
It scarcely needs proof that this spurious “Marxism,” designed to
hide the nakedness of opportunism, is merely a European variety of the
selfsame theory of “khvostism” which Lenin fought even before the first
Russian revolution.
It scarcely needs proof that the demolition of this theoretical falsi13. See Karl Marx, “Theses on Feuerbach” (Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, Selected
Works, Moscow, 1951, Vol. II, p. 367).

22

3. Theory

fication is a preliminary condition for the creation of truly revolutionary
parties in the West.
3) The theory of the proletarian revolution. Lenin’s theory of the proletarian revolution proceeds from three fundamental theses.
First thesis: The domination of finance capital in the advanced capitalist countries; the issue of stocks and bonds as one of the principal operations of finance capital; the export of capital to the sources of raw materials, which is one of the foundations of imperialism; the omnipotence
of a financial oligarchy, which is the result of the domination of finance
capital—all this reveals the grossly parasitic character of monopolist capitalism, makes the yoke of the capitalist trusts and syndicates a hundred
times more burdensome, intensifies the indignation of the working class
with the foundations of capitalism, and brings the masses to the proletarian revolution as their only salvation. (See Lenin, Imperialism).14
Hence the first conclusion: intensification of the revolutionary crisis
within the capitalist countries and growth of the elements of an explosion
on the internal, proletarian front in the “metropolises.”
Second thesis: The increase in the export of capital to the colonies and
dependent countries; the expansion of “spheres of influence” and colonial
possessions until they cover the whole globe; the transformation of capitalism into a world system of financial enslavement and colonial oppression of the vast majority of the population of the world by a handful of
“advanced” countries—all this has, on the one hand, converted the separate national economies and national territories into links in a single chain
called world economy, and, on the other hand, split the population of the
globe into two camps: a handful of “advanced” capitalist countries which
exploit and oppress vast colonies and dependencies, and the huge majority
consisting of colonial and dependent countries which are compelled to
wage a struggle for liberation from the imperialist yoke (see Imperialism).
Hence the second conclusion: intensification of the revolutionary
crisis in the colonial countries and growth of the elements of revolt against
imperialism on the external, colonial front.
Third thesis: The monopolistic possession of “spheres of influence”
14. See V. I. Lenin, “Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism,” Works, 4th Russ. ed.,
Vol. 22, pp. 173-290.

23

The Foundations of Leninism

and colonies; the uneven development of the capitalist countries, leading
to a frenzied struggle for the redivision of the world between the countries
which have already seized territories and those claiming their “share”; imperialist wars as the only means of restoring the disturbed “equilibrium”—
all this leads to the intensification of the struggle on the third front, the
inter-capitalist front, which weakens imperialism and facilitates the union
of the first two fronts against imperialism: the front of the revolutionary
proletariat and the front of colonial emancipation (see Imperialism).
Hence the third conclusion: that under imperialism wars cannot be
averted, and that a coalition between the proletarian revolution in Europe
and the colonial revolution in the East in a united world front of revolution against the world front of imperialism is inevitable.
Lenin combines all these conclusions into one general conclusion
that “imperialism is the eve of the socialist revolution.”15 (See Vol. XIX, p.
71.)
The very approach to the question of the proletarian revolution, of
the character of the revolution, of its scope, of its depth, the scheme of the
revolution in general, changes accordingly.
Formerly, the analysis of the pre-requisites for the proletarian revolution was usually approached from the point of view of the economic state
of individual countries. Now, this approach is no longer adequate. Now
the matter must be approached from the point of view of the economic
state of all or the majority of countries, from the point of view of the state
of world economy; for individual countries and individual national economies have ceased to be self-sufficient units, have become links in a single
chain called world economy; for the old “cultured” capitalism has evolved
into imperialism, and imperialism is a world system of financial enslavement and colonial oppression of the vast majority of the population of the
world by a handful of “advanced” countries.
Formerly it was the accepted thing to speak of the existence or
absence of objective conditions for the proletarian revolution in individual
countries, or, to be more precise, in one or another developed country.
Now this point of view is no longer adequate. Now we must speak of the
existence of objective conditions for the revolution in the entire system of
15   My italics—J. St.

24

3. Theory

world imperialist economy as an integral whole; the existence within this
system of some countries that are not sufficiently developed industrially
cannot serve as an insuperable obstacle to the revolution, if the system as a
whole or, more correctly, because the system as a whole is already ripe for
revolution.
Formerly it was the accepted thing to speak of the proletarian revolution in one or another developed country as of a separate and self-sufficient entity opposing a separate national front of capital as its antipode.
Now, this point of view is no longer adequate. Now we must speak of the
world proletarian revolution; for the separate national fronts of capital
have become links in a single chain called the world front of imperialism,
which must be opposed by a common front of the revolutionary movement in all countries.
Formerly the proletarian revolution was regarded exclusively as the
result of the internal development of a given country. Now, this point
of view is no longer adequate. Now the proletarian revolution must be
regarded primarily as the result of the development of the contradictions
within the world system of imperialism, as the result of the breaking of the
chain of the world imperialist front in one country or another.
Where will the revolution begin? Where, in what country, can the
front of capital be pierced first?
Where industry is more developed, where the proletariat constitutes
the majority, where there is more culture, where there is more democracy—that was the reply usually given formerly.
No, objects the Leninist theory of revolution, not necessarily where
industry is more developed, and so forth. The front of capital will be pierced
where the chain of imperialism is weakest, for the proletarian revolution is
the result of the breaking of the chain of the world imperialist front at its
weakest link; and it may turn out that the country which has started the
revolution, which has made a breach in the front of capital, is less developed in a capitalist sense than other, more developed, countries, which
have, however, remained within the framework of capitalism.
In 1917 the chain of the imperialist world front proved to be weaker
in Russia than in the other countries. It was there that the chain broke
and provided an outlet for the proletarian revolution. Why? Because in
Russia a great popular revolution was unfolding, and at its head marched
25

The Foundations of Leninism

the revolutionary proletariat, which had such an important ally as the vast
mass of the peasantry, which was oppressed and exploited by the landlords.
Because the revolution there was opposed by such a hideous representative
of imperialism as tsarism, which lacked all moral prestige and was deservedly hated by the whole population. The chain proved to be weaker in
Russia, although Russia was less developed in a capitalist sense than, say,
France or Germany, Britain or America.
Where will the chain break in the near future? Again, where it
is weakest. It is not precluded that the chain may break, say, in India.
Why? Because that country has a young, militant, revolutionary proletariat, which has such an ally as the national liberation movement—an
undoubtedly powerful and undoubtedly important ally. Because there the
revolution is confronted by such a well-known foe as foreign imperialism,
which has no moral credit and is deservedly hated by all the oppressed and
exploited masses of India.
It is also quite possible that the chain will break in Germany. Why?
Because the factors which are operating, say, in India are beginning to
operate in Germany as well; but, of course, the enormous difference in the
level of development between India and Germany cannot but stamp its
imprint on the progress and outcome of a revolution in Germany.
That is why Lenin said that:
“The West-European capitalist countries will consummate their development towards socialism... not by the even
‘maturing’ of socialism in them, but by the exploitation of
some countries by others, by the exploitation of the first of the
countries to be vanquished in the imperialist war combined
with the exploitation of the whole of the East. On the other
hand, precisely as a result of the first imperialist war, the East
has definitely come into revolutionary movement, has been
definitely drawn into the general maelstrom of the world revolutionary movement.” (See Vol. XXVII, pp. 415-16.)
Briefly: the chain of the imperialist front must, as a rule, break where
the links are weaker and, at all events, not necessarily where capitalism is
more developed, where there is such and such a percentage of proletarians
26

3. Theory

and such and such a percentage of peasants, and so on.
That is why in deciding the question of proletarian revolution statistical estimates of the percentage of the proletarian population in a given
country lose the exceptional importance so eagerly attached to them by
the doctrinaires of the Second International, who have not understood
imperialism and who fear revolution like the plague.
To proceed. The heroes of the Second International asserted (and
continue to assert) that between the bourgeois-democratic revolution and
the proletarian revolution there is a chasm, or at any rate a Chinese Wall,
separating one from the other by a more or less protracted interval of
time, during which the bourgeoisie having come into power, develops capitalism, while the proletariat accumulates strength and prepares for the
“decisive struggle” against capitalism. This interval is usually calculated to
extend over many decades, if not longer. It scarcely needs proof that this
Chinese Wall “theory” is totally devoid of scientific meaning under the
conditions of imperialism, that it is and can be only a means of concealing
and camouflaging the counter-revolutionary aspirations of the bourgeoisie.
It scarcely needs proof that under the conditions of imperialism, fraught
as it is with collisions and wars; under the conditions of the “eve of the
socialist revolution,” when “flourishing” capitalism becomes “moribund”
capitalism (Lenin) and the revolutionary movement is growing in all countries of the world; when imperialism is allying itself with all reactionary
forces without exception, down to and including tsarism and serfdom,
thus making imperative the coalition of all revolutionary forces, from the
proletarian movement of the West to the national liberation movement of
the East; when the overthrow of the survivals of the regime of feudal serfdom becomes impossible without a revolutionary struggle against imperialism—it scarcely needs proof that the bourgeois-democratic revolution,
in a more or less developed country, must under such circumstances verge
upon the proletarian revolution, that the former must pass into the latter.
The history of the revolution in Russia has provided palpable proof that
this thesis is correct and incontrovertible. It was not without reason that
Lenin, as far back as 1905, on the eve of the first Russian revolution, in his
pamphlet Two Tactics depicted the bourgeois-democratic revolution and
the socialist revolution as two links in the same chain, as a single and integral picture of the sweep of the Russian revolution:
27

The Foundations of Leninism

“The proletariat must carry to completion the democratic
revolution, by allying to itself the mass of the peasantry in order
to crush by force the resistance of the autocracy and to paralyse the
instability of the bourgeoisie. The proletariat must accomplish the
socialist revolution, by allying to itself the mass of the semi-proletarian elements of the population in order to crush by force the
resistance of the bourgeoisie and to paralyse the instability of the
peasantry and the petty bourgeoisie. Such are the tasks of the
proletariat, which the new Iskra-ists present so narrowly in all
their arguments and resolutions about the sweep of the revolution.” (See Vol. VIII, p. 96.)
There is no need to mention other, later works of Lenin’s, in which
the idea of the bourgeois revolution passing into the proletarian revolution
stands out in greater relief than in Two Tactics as one of the cornerstones of
the Leninist theory of revolution.
Some comrades believe, it seems, that Lenin arrived at this idea only
in 1916, that up to that time he had thought that the revolution in Russia
would remain within the bourgeois framework, that power, consequently,
would pass from the hands of the organ of the dictatorship of the proletariat and peasantry into the hands of the bourgeoisie and not of the proletariat. It is said that this assertion has even penetrated into our communist
press. I must say that this assertion is absolutely wrong, that it is totally at
variance with the facts.
I might refer to Lenin’s well-known speech at the Third Congress of
the Party (1905), in which he defined the dictatorship of the proletariat
and peasantry, i.e., the victory of the democratic revolution, not as the
“organisation of ‘order’ “ but as the “organisation of war”. (See Vol. VII,
p. 264.)
Further, I might refer to Lenin’s well-known articles “On a Provisional Government” (1905),16 where, outlining the prospects of the
16. J. V. Stalin refers to the following articles written by V. I. Lenin in 1905: “Social-Democracy and a Provisional Revolutionary Government,” from which he cites a passage;
“The Revolutionary Democratic Dictatorship of the Proletariat and Peasantry”; and “On
a Provisional Revolutionary Government” (see V. I. Lenin, Works, 4th Russ. ed., Vol. 8,
pp. 247-63, 264-74, 427-47)

28

3. Theory

unfolding Russian revolution, he assigns to the Party the task of “ensuring
that the Russian revolution is not a movement of a few months, but a
movement of many years, that it leads, not merely to slight concessions
on the part of the powers that be, but to the complete overthrow of those
powers”; where, enlarging further on these prospects and linking them
with the revolution in Europe, he goes on to say:
“And if we succeed in doing that, then ... then the revolutionary conflagration will spread all over Europe; the European worker, languishing under bourgeois reaction, will rise in
his turn and will show us ‘how it is done’; then the revolutionary wave in Europe will sweep back again into Russia and will
convert an epoch of a few revolutionary years into an epoch of
several revolutionary decades...” (Ibid., p. 191.)
I might further refer to a well-known article by Lenin published in
November 1915, in which he writes:
“The proletariat is fighting, and will fight valiantly,
to capture power, for a republic, for the confiscation of the
land ... for the participation of the ‘non-proletarian masses of
the people’ in liberating bourgeois Russia from military-feudal ‘imperialism’ (=tsarism). And the proletariat will immediately17 take advantage of this liberation of bourgeois Russia
from tsarism, from the agrarian power of the landlords, not to
aid the rich peasants in their struggle against the rural worker,
but to bring about the socialist revolution in alliance with the
proletarians of Europe.” (See Vol. XVIII, p. 318.)
Finally, I might refer to the well-known passage in Lenin’s pamphlet
The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky, where, referring to
the above-quoted passage in Two Tactics on the sweep of the Russian revolution, he arrives at the following conclusion:

17

My italics—J. St.

29

The Foundations of Leninism

“Things turned out just as we said they would. The
course taken by the revolution confirmed the correctness of
our reasoning. First, with the ‘whole’ of the peasantry against
the monarchy, against the landlords, against the medieval
regime (and to that extent the revolution remains bourgeois,
bourgeois-democratic). Then, with the poor peasants, with the
semi-proletarians, with all the exploited, against capitalism,
including the rural rich, the kulaks, the profiteers, and to that
extent the revolution becomes a socialist one. To attempt to
raise an artificial Chinese Wall between the first and second,
to separate them by anything else than the degree of preparedness of the proletariat and the degree of its unity with the poor
peasants, means monstrously to distort Marxism, to vulgarise
it, to replace it by liberalism.” (See Vol. XXIII, p. 391.)
That is sufficient, I think.
Very well, we may be told; but if that is the case, why did Lenin
combat the idea of “permanent (uninterrupted) revolution”?
Because Lenin proposed that the revolutionary capacities of the peasantry be “exhausted” and that the fullest use be made of their revolutionary
energy for the complete liquidation of tsarism and for the transition to the
proletarian revolution, whereas the adherents of “permanent revolution”
did not understand the important role of the peasantry in the Russian
revolution, underestimated the strength of the revolutionary energy of the
peasantry, underestimated the strength and ability of the Russian proletariat to lead the peasantry, and thereby hampered the work of emancipating
the peasantry from the influence of the bourgeoisie, the work of rallying
the peasantry around the proletariat.
Because Lenin proposed that the revolution be crowned with the
transfer of power to the proletariat, whereas the adherents of “permanent”
revolution wanted to begin at once with the establishment of the power of
the proletariat, failing to realise that in so doing they were closing their
eyes to such a “minor detail” as the survivals of serfdom and were leaving
out of account so important a force as the Russian peasantry, failing to
understand that such a policy could only retard the winning of the peasantry over to the side of the proletariat.
30

3. Theory

Consequently, Lenin fought the adherents of “permanent” revolution, not over the question of uninterruptedness, for Lenin himself maintained the point of view of uninterrupted revolution, but because they
underestimated the role of the peasantry, which is an enormous reserve of
the proletariat, because they failed to understand the idea of the hegemony
of the proletariat.
The idea of “permanent” revolution should not be regarded as a new
idea. It was first advanced by Marx at the end of the forties in his wellknown Address to the Communist League (1850). It is from this document
that our “permanentists” took the idea of uninterrupted revolution. It
should be noted that in taking it from Marx our “permanentists” altered
it somewhat, and in altering it “spoilt” it and made it unfit for practical
use. The experienced hand of Lenin was needed to rectify this mistake, to
take Marx’s idea of uninterrupted revolution in its pure form and make it
a cornerstone of his theory of revolution.
Here is what Marx says in his Address about uninterrupted (permanent) revolution, after enumerating a number of revolutionary-democratic
demands which he calls upon the Communists to win:
“While the democratic petty bourgeois wish to bring the
revolution to a conclusion as quickly as possible, and with the
achievement, at most, of the above demands, it is our interest
and our task to make the revolution permanent, until all more
or less possessing classes have been forced out of their position
of dominance, until the proletariat has conquered state power,
and the association of proletarians, not only in one country
but in all the dominant countries of the world, has advanced
so far that competition among the proletarians of these countries has ceased and that at least the decisive productive forces
are concentrated in the hands of the proletarians.”18
In other words:
a) Marx did not at all propose to begin the revolution in the Germany
18. Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, “Address of the Central Committee to the Communist League,” Selected Works, Moscow, 1951, Vol. I, p. 102.

31

The Foundations of Leninism

of the fifties with the immediate establishment of proletarian power—contrary to the plans of our Russian “permanentists.”
b) Marx proposed only that the revolution be crowned with the
establishment of proletarian state power, by hurling, step by step, one section of the bourgeoisie after another from the heights of power, in order,
after the attainment of power by the proletariat, to kindle the fire of revolution in every country—and everything that Lenin taught and carried out
in the course of our revolution in pursuit of his theory of the proletarian
revolution under the conditions of imperialism was fully in line with that
proposition.
It follows, then, that our Russian “permanentists” have not only
underestimated the role of the peasantry in the Russian revolution and the
importance of the idea of the hegemony of the proletariat, but have altered
(for the worse) Marx’s idea of “permanent” revolution and made it unfit
for practical use.
That is why Lenin ridiculed the theory of our “permanentists,” calling it “original” and “fine,” and accusing them of refusing to “think why,
for ten whole years, life has passed by this fine theory.” (Lenin’s article was
written in 1915, ten years after the appearance of the theory of the “permanentists” in Russia. See Vol. XVIII, p. 317.)
That is why Lenin regarded this theory as a semi-Menshevik theory
and said that it “borrows from the Bolsheviks their call for a resolute revolutionary struggle by the proletariat and the conquest of political power
by the latter, and from the Mensheviks the ‘repudiation’ of the role of the
peasantry.” (See Lenin’s article “Two Lines of the Revolution,” ibid.)
This, then, is the position in regard to Lenin’s idea of the bourgeois-democratic revolution passing into the proletarian revolution, of
utilising the bourgeois revolution for the “immediate” transition to the
proletarian revolution.
To proceed. Formerly, the victory of the revolution in one country
was considered impossible, on the assumption that it would require the
combined action of the proletarians of all or at least of a majority of the
advanced countries to achieve victory over the bourgeoisie. Now this point
of view no longer fits in with the facts. Now we must proceed from the
possibility of such a victory, for the uneven and spasmodic character of the
development of the various capitalist countries under the conditions of
32

3. Theory

imperialism, the development within imperialism of catastrophic contradictions leading to inevitable wars, the growth of the revolutionary movement in all countries of the world—all this leads, not only to the possibility, but also to the necessity of the victory of the proletariat in individual
countries. The history of the revolution in Russia is direct proof of this. At
the same time, however, it must be borne in mind that the overthrow of
the bourgeoisie can be successfully accomplished only when certain absolutely necessary conditions exist, in the absence of which there can be even
no question of the proletariat taking power.
Here is what Lenin says about these conditions in his pamphlet
“Left-Wing” Communism:
“The fundamental law of revolution, which has been
confirmed by all revolutions, and particularly by all three Russian revolutions in the twentieth century, is as follows: it is
not enough for revolution that the exploited and oppressed
masses should understand the impossibility of living in the
old way and demand changes; it is essential for revolution that
the exploiters should not be able to live and rule in the old
way. Only when the ‘lower classes’ do not want the old way, and
when the ‘upper classes’ cannot carry on in the old way—only
then can revolution triumph. This truth may be expressed in
other words: revolution is impossible without a nation-wide crisis (affecting both the exploited and the exploiters).19 It follows
that for revolution it is essential, first, that a majority of the
workers (or at least a majority of the class conscious, thinking, politically active workers) should fully understand that
revolution is necessary and be ready to sacrifice their lives for
it; secondly, that the ruling classes should be passing through
a governmental crisis, which draws even the most backward
masses into politics ... weakens the government and makes it
possible for the revolutionaries to overthrow it rapidly.” (See
Vol. XXV, p. 222.)

The Foundations of Leninism

But the overthrow of the power of the bourgeoisie and establishment of the power of the proletariat in one country does not yet mean that
the complete victory of socialism has been ensured. After consolidating its
power and leading the peasantry in its wake the proletariat of the victorious country can and must build a socialist society. But does this mean
that it will thereby achieve the complete and final victory of socialism,
i.e., does it mean that with the forces of only one country it can finally
consolidate socialism and fully guarantee that country against intervention
and, consequently, also against restoration? No, it does not. For this the
victory of the revolution in at least several countries is needed. Therefore,
the development and support of revolution in other countries is an essential task of the victorious revolution. Therefore, the revolution which has
been victorious in one country must regard itself not as a self-sufficient
entity, but as an aid, as a means for hastening the victory of the proletariat
in other countries.
Lenin expressed this thought succinctly when he said that the task
of the victorious revolution is to do “the utmost possible in one country
for the development, support and awakening of the revolution in all countries.” (See Vol. XXIII, p. 385.)
These, in general, are the characteristic features of Lenin’s theory of
proletarian revolution.

4. The Dictatorship of the Proletariat

Chapter IV.

The Dictatorship of the Proletariat
From this theme I take three fundamental questions:
a)  the dictatorship of the proletariat as the instrument of the proletarian revolution;
b)  the dictatorship of the proletariat as the rule of the proletariat
over the bourgeoisie;
c)  Soviet power as the state form of the dictatorship of the proletariat.
1) The dictatorship of the proletariat as the instrument of the proletarian revolution. The question of the proletarian dictatorship is above all a
question of the main content of the proletarian revolution. The proletarian
revolution, its movement, its sweep and its achievements acquire flesh and
blood only through the dictatorship of the proletariat. The dictatorship of
the proletariat is the instrument of the proletarian revolution, its organ, its
most important mainstay, brought into being for the purpose of, firstly,
crushing the resistance of the overthrown exploiters and consolidating the
achievements of the proletarian revolution, and, secondly, carrying the
proletarian revolution to its completion, carrying the revolution to the
complete victory of socialism. The revolution can defeat the bourgeoisie,
can overthrow its power, even without the dictatorship of the proletariat.
But the revolution will be unable to crush the resistance of the bourgeoisie,
to maintain its victory and to push forward to the final victory of socialism
unless, at a certain stage in its development, it creates a special organ in the
form of the dictatorship of the proletariat as its principal mainstay.
“The fundamental question of every revolution is the question of
power” (Lenin). Does this mean that all that is required is to assume power,
to seize it? No, it does not. The seizure of power is only the beginning. For
many reasons, the bourgeoisie that is overthrown in one country remains
for a long time stronger than the proletariat which has overthrown it.
Therefore, the whole point is to retain power, to consolidate it, to make
it invincible. What is needed to attain this? To attain this it is necessary
to carry out at least three main tasks that confront the dictatorship of the
35

The Foundations of Leninism

proletariat “on the morrow” of victory:
a) to break the resistance of the landlords and capitalists who have
been overthrown and expropriated by the revolution, to liquidate every
attempt on their part to restore the power of capital;
b) to organise construction in such a way as to rally all the working
people around the proletariat, and to carry on this work along the lines of
preparing for the elimination, the abolition of classes;
c) to arm the revolution, to organise the army of the revolution for
the struggle against foreign enemies, for the struggle against imperialism.
The dictatorship of the proletariat is needed to carry out, to fulfil
these tasks.
“The transition from capitalism to communism,” says
Lenin, “represents an entire historical epoch. Until this epoch
has terminated, the exploiters inevitably cherish the hope of
restoration, and this hope is converted into attempts at restoration. And after their first serious defeat, the overthrown
exploiters—who had not expected their overthrow, never
believed it possible, never conceded the thought of it—throw
themselves with energy grown tenfold, with furious passion
and hatred grown a hundredfold, into the battle for the recovery of the ‘paradise’ of which they have been deprived, on
behalf of their families, who had been leading such a sweet
and easy life and whom now the ‘common herd’ is condemning to ruin and destitution (or to ‘common’ labour...). In the
train of the capitalist exploiters follow the broad masses of the
petty bourgeoisie, with regard to whom decades of historical
experience of all countries testify that they vacillate and hesitate, one day marching behind the proletariat and the next
day taking fright at the difficulties of the revolution; that they
become panic-stricken at the first defeat or semi-defeat of the
workers, grow nervous, rush about, snivel, and run from one
camp into the other.” (See Vol. XXIII, p. 355.)
The bourgeoisie has its grounds for making attempts at restoration,
because for a long time after its overthrow it remains stronger than the
36

4. The Dictatorship of the Proletariat

proletariat which has overthrown it.
“If the exploiters are defeated in one country only,” says
Lenin, “and this, of course, is the typical case, since a simultaneous revolution in a number of countries is a rare exception,
they still remain stronger than the exploited.” (Ibid., p. 354.)
Wherein lies the strength of the overthrown bourgeoisie?
Firstly, “in the strength of international capital, in the
strength and durability of the international connections of the
bourgeoisie.” (See Vol. XXV, p. 173.)
Secondly, in the fact that “for a long time after the
revolution the exploiters inevitably retain a number of great
practical advantages: they still have money (it is impossible
to abolish money all at once); some movable property—often
fairly considerable; they still have various connections, habits
of organisation and management, knowledge of all the ‘secrets’
(customs, methods, means and possibilities) of management,
superior education, close connections with the higher technical personnel (who live and think like the bourgeoisie),
incomparably greater experience in the art of war (this is very
important), and so on, and so forth.” (See Vol. XXIII, p. 354.)
Thirdly, “in the force of habit, in the strength of small
production. For, unfortunately, small production is still very,
very widespread in the world, and small production engenders
capitalism and the bourgeoisie continuously, daily, hourly,
spontaneously, and on a mass scale”... for “the abolition of
classes means not only driving out the landlords and capitalists—that we accomplished with comparative ease—it also
means abolishing the small commodity producers, and they cannot be driven out, or crushed; we must live in harmony with
them, they can (and must) be remoulded and re-educated
only by very prolonged, slow, cautious organisational work.”
(See Vol. XXV, pp. 173 and 189.)
37

The Foundations of Leninism

That is why Lenin says that:
“The dictatorship of the proletariat is a most determined
and most ruthless war waged by the new class against a more
powerful enemy, the bourgeoisie, whose resistance is increased
tenfold by its overthrow,”
and that:
“The dictatorship of the proletariat is a stubborn struggle—bloody and bloodless, violent and peaceful, military and
economic, educational and administrative—against the forces
and traditions of the old society.” (Ibid., pp. 173 and 190.)
It scarcely needs proof that there is not the slightest possibility of
carrying out these tasks in a short period, of accomplishing all this in a
few years. Therefore, the dictatorship of the proletariat, the transition
from capitalism to communism, must not be regarded as a fleeting period
of “super-revolutionary” acts and decrees, but as an entire historical era,
replete with civil wars and external conflicts, with persistent organisational
work and economic construction, with advances and retreats, victories and
defeats. This historical era is needed not only to create the economic and
cultural prerequisites for the complete victory of socialism, but also to
enable the proletariat, firstly, to educate itself and become steeled as a force
capable of governing the country, and, secondly, to re-educate and remould
the petty-bourgeois strata along such lines as will assure the organisation of
socialist production.
“You will have to go through fifteen, twenty, fifty years
of civil wars and international conflicts,” Marx said to the
workers, “not only to change existing conditions, but also to
change yourselves and to make yourselves capable of wielding
political power.” (See K. Marx and F. Engels, Works, Vol. VIII,
p. 506.)

38

4. The Dictatorship of the Proletariat

that:

Continuing and developing Marx’s idea still further, Lenin wrote
“It will be necessary under the dictatorship of the proletariat to re-educate millions of peasants and small proprietors, hundreds of thousands of office employees, officials and
bourgeois intellectuals, to subordinate them all to the proletarian state and to proletarian leadership, to overcome their
bourgeois habits and traditions,” just as we must “- in a protracted struggle waged on the basis of the dictatorship of the
proletariat—re-educate the proletarians themselves, who do
not abandon their petty-bourgeois prejudices at one stroke,
by a miracle, at the bidding of the Virgin Mary, at the bidding
of a slogan, resolution or decree, but only in the course of a
long and difficult mass struggle against mass petty-bourgeois
influences.” (See Vol. XXV, pp. 248 and 247.)

2) The dictatorship of the proletariat as the rule of the proletariat over
the bourgeoisie. From the foregoing it is evident that the dictatorship of
the proletariat is not a mere change of personalities in the government, a
change of the “cabinet,” etc., leaving the old economic and political order
intact. The Mensheviks and opportunists of all countries, who fear dictatorship like fire and in their fright substitute the concept “conquest of
power” for the concept of dictatorship, usually reduce the “conquest of
power” to a change of the “cabinet,” to the accession to power of a new
ministry made up of people like Scheidemann and Noske, MacDonald
and Henderson. It is hardly necessary to explain that these and similar
cabinet changes have nothing in common with the dictatorship of the proletariat, with the conquest of real power by the real proletariat. With the
MacDonalds and Scheidemanns in power, while the old bourgeois order
is allowed to remain, their so-called governments cannot be anything else
than an apparatus serving the bourgeoisie, a screen to conceal the ulcers of
imperialism, a weapon in the hands of the bourgeoisie against the revolutionary movement of the oppressed and exploited masses. Capital needs
such governments as a screen when it finds it inconvenient, unprofitable,
difficult to oppress and exploit the masses without the aid of a screen. Of
39

The Foundations of Leninism

course, the appearance of such governments is a symptom that “over there”
(i.e., in the capitalist camp) all is not quiet “at the Shipka Pass”20; nevertheless, governments of this kind inevitably remain governments of capital
in disguise. The government of a MacDonald or a Scheidemann is as far
removed from the conquest of power by the proletariat as the sky from the
earth. The dictatorship of the proletariat is not a change of government,
but a new state, with new organs of power, both central and local; it is the
state of the proletariat, which has arisen on the ruins of the old state, the
state of the bourgeoisie.
The dictatorship of the proletariat arises not on the basis of the bourgeois order, but in the process of the breaking up of this order, after the
overthrow of the bourgeoisie, in the process of the expropriation of the
landlords and capitalists, in the process of the socialisation of the principal
instruments and means of production, in the process of violent proletarian
revolution. The dictatorship of the proletariat is a revolutionary power
based on the use of force against the bourgeoisie.
The state is a machine in the hands of the ruling class for suppressing the resistance of its class enemies. In this respect the dictatorship of the
proletariat does not differ essentially from the dictatorship of any other
class, for the proletarian state is a machine for the suppression of the bourgeoisie. But there is one substantial difference. This difference consists in
the fact that all hitherto existing class states have been dictatorships of an
exploiting minority over the exploited majority, whereas the dictatorship
of the proletariat is the dictatorship of the exploited majority over the
exploiting minority.
Briefly: the dictatorship of the proletariat is the rule—unrestricted by
law and based on force—of the proletariat over the bourgeoisie, a rule enjoying
the sympathy and support of the labouring and exploited masses. (Lenin, The
State and Revolution)
From this follow two main conclusions:
First conclusion: The dictatorship of the proletariat cannot be “complete” democracy, democracy for all, for the rich as well as for the poor; the
dictatorship of the proletariat “must be a state that is democratic in a new

40

4. The Dictatorship of the Proletariat

way (for the proletarians and the non-propertied in general) and dictatorial in a new way (against21 the bourgeoisie).” (See Vol. XXI, p. 393.) The
talk of Kautsky and Co. about universal equality, about “pure” democracy,
about “perfect” democracy, and the like, is a bourgeois disguise of the indubitable fact that equality between exploited and exploiters is impossible.
The theory of “pure” democracy is the theory of the upper stratum of the
working class, which has been broken in and is being fed by the imperialist
robbers. It was brought into being for the purpose of concealing the ulcers
of capitalism, of embellishing imperialism and lending it moral strength
in the struggle against the exploited masses. Under capitalism there are no
real “liberties” for the exploited, nor can there be, if for no other reason
than that the premises, printing plants, paper supplies, etc., indispensable
for the enjoyment of “liberties” are the privilege of the exploiters. Under
capitalism the exploited masses do not, nor can they ever, really participate
in governing the country, if for no other reason than that, even under the
most democratic regime, under conditions of capitalism, governments are
not set up by the people but by the Rothschilds and Stinneses, the Rockefellers and Morgans. Democracy under capitalism is capitalist democracy,
the democracy of the exploiting minority, based on the restriction of the
rights of the exploited majority and directed against this majority. Only
under the proletarian dictatorship are real liberties for the exploited and
real participation of the proletarians and peasants in governing the country possible. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, democracy is proletarian democracy, the democracy of the exploited majority, based on the
restriction of the rights of the exploiting minority and directed against this
minority.
Second conclusion: The dictatorship of the proletariat cannot arise as
the result of the peaceful development of bourgeois society and of bourgeois democracy; it can arise only as the result of the smashing of the
bourgeois state machine, the bourgeois army, the bourgeois bureaucratic
apparatus, the bourgeois police.
“The working class cannot simply lay hold of the readymade state machinery, and wield it for its own purposes,” say
21. My italics—J. St.

41

The Foundations of Leninism

Marx and Engels in a preface to the Communist Manifesto.
The task of the proletarian revolution is “no longer, as
before, to transfer the bureaucratic-military machine from
one hand to another, but to smash it... this is the preliminary
condition for every real people’s revolution on the continent,”
says Marx in his letter to Kugelmann in 1871.22
Marx’s qualifying phrase about the continent gave the opportunists and Mensheviks of all countries a pretext for clamouring that Marx
had thus conceded the possibility of the peaceful evolution of bourgeois
democracy into a proletarian democracy, at least in certain countries outside the European continent (Britain, America). Marx did in fact concede
that possibility, and he had good grounds for conceding it in regard to
Britain and America in the seventies of the last century, when monopoly
capitalism and imperialism did not yet exist, and when these countries,
owing to the particular conditions of their development, had as yet no
developed militarism and bureaucracy. That was the situation before the
appearance of developed imperialism. But later, after a lapse of thirty or
forty years, when the situation in these countries had radically changed,
when imperialism had developed and had embraced all capitalist countries without exception, when militarism and bureaucracy had appeared
in Britain and America also, when the particular conditions for peaceful
development in Britain and America had disappeared—then the qualification in regard to these countries necessarily could no longer hold good.
“Today,” said Lenin, “in 1917, in the epoch of the first
great imperialist war, this qualification made by Marx is no
longer valid. Both Britain and America, the biggest and the
last representatives—in the whole world—of Anglo-Saxon
‘liberty’ in the sense that they had no militarism and bureaucracy, have completely sunk into the all-European filthy,
bloody morass of bureaucratic-military institutions which
subordinate everything to themselves and trample everything
22. Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, Selected Works, Moscow. 1951. Vol. I, p. 22, and
Vol. II, p. 420.

42

4. The Dictatorship of the Proletariat

underfoot. Today, in Britain and in America, too, ‘the preliminary condition for every real people’s revolution’ is the
smashing, the destruction of the ‘ready-made state machinery’
(perfected in those countries, between 1914 and 1917, up to
the ‘European’ general imperialist standard).” (See Vol. XXI,
p. 395.)
In other words, the law of violent proletarian revolution, the law of
the smashing of the bourgeois state machine as a preliminary condition for
such a revolution, is an inevitable law of the revolutionary movement in
the imperialist countries of the world.
Of course, in the remote future, if the proletariat is victorious in
the principal capitalist countries, and if the present capitalist encirclement
is replaced by a socialist encirclement, a “peaceful” path of development
is quite possible for certain capitalist countries, whose capitalists, in view
of the “unfavourable” international situation, will consider it expedient
“voluntarily” to make substantial concessions to the proletariat. But this
supposition applies only to a remote and possible future. With regard to
the immediate future, there is no ground whatsoever for this supposition.
Therefore, Lenin is right in saying:
“The proletarian revolution is impossible without the
forcible destruction of the bourgeois state machine and the
substitution for it of a new one.” (See Vol. XXIII, p. 342.)
3) Soviet power as the state form of the dictatorship of the proletariat.
The victory of the dictatorship of the proletariat signifies the suppression
of the bourgeoisie, the smashing of the bourgeois state machine, and the
substitution of proletarian democracy for bourgeois democracy. That is
clear. But by means of what organisations can this colossal work be carried
out? The old forms of organisation of the proletariat, which grew up on
the basis of bourgeois parliamentarism, are inadequate for this work—of
that there can hardly be any doubt. What, then, are the new forms of
organisation of the proletariat that are capable of serving as the gravediggers of the bourgeois state machine, that are capable not only of smashing
this machine, not only of substituting proletarian democracy for bourgeois
43

The Foundations of Leninism

democracy, but also of becoming the foundation of the proletarian state
power?
This new form of organisation of the proletariat is the Soviets.
Wherein lies the strength of the Soviets as compared with the old
forms of organisation?
In that the Soviets are the most all-embracing mass organisations
of the proletariat, for they and they alone embrace all workers without
exception.
In that the Soviets are the only mass organisations which unite all
the oppressed and exploited, workers and peasants, soldiers and sailors,
and in which the vanguard of the masses, the proletariat, can, for this
reason, most easily and most completely exercise its political leadership of
the mass struggle.
In that the Soviets are the most powerful organs of the revolutionary
struggle of the masses, of the political actions of the masses, of the uprising
of the masses—organs capable of breaking the omnipotence of finance
capital and its political appendages.
In that the Soviets are the immediate organisations of the masses
themselves, i.e., they are the most democratic and therefore the most authoritative organisations of the masses, which facilitate to the utmost their
participation in the work of building up the new state and in its administration, and which bring into full play the revolutionary energy, initiative
and creative abilities of the masses in the struggle for the destruction of the
old order, in the struggle for the new, proletarian order.
Soviet power is the union and constitution of the local Soviets into
one common state organisation, into the state organisation of the proletariat as the vanguard of the oppressed and exploited masses and as the ruling
class—their union in the Republic of Soviets.
The essence of Soviet power consists in the fact that these most
all-embracing and most revolutionary mass organisations of precisely
those classes that were oppressed by the capitalists and landlords are now
the “permanent and sole basis of the whole power of the state, of the whole
state apparatus”; that “precisely those masses which even in the most democratic bourgeois republics,” while being equal in law, “have in fact been
prevented by thousands of tricks and devices from taking part in political life and from enjoying democratic rights and liberties, are now drawn
44

4. The Dictatorship of the Proletariat

unfailingly into constant and, moreover, decisive participation in the democratic administration of the state.”23 (See Lenin, Vol. XXIV, p. 13.)
That is why Soviet power is a new form of state organisation, different in principle from the old bourgeois-democratic and parliamentary
form, a new type of state, adapted not to the task of exploiting and oppressing the labouring masses, but to the task of completely emancipating them
from all oppression and exploitation, to the tasks facing the dictatorship
of the proletariat.
Lenin is right in saying that with the appearance of Soviet power
“the era of bourgeois-democratic parliamentarism has drawn to a close and
a new chapter in world history—the era of proletarian dictatorship—has
been opened.”
Wherein lie the characteristic features of Soviet power?
In that Soviet power is the most all-embracing and most democratic
state organisation of all possible state organisations while classes continue
to exist; for, being the arena of the bond and collaboration between the
workers and the exploited peasants in their struggle against the exploiters, and basing itself in its work on this bond and on this collaboration,
Soviet power is thus the power of the majority of the population over the
minority, it is the state of the majority, the expression of its dictatorship.
In that Soviet power is the most internationalist of all state organisations in class society, for, by destroying every kind of national oppression
and resting on the collaboration of the labouring masses of the various
nationalities, it facilitates the uniting of these masses into a single state
union.
In that Soviet power, by its very structure, facilitates the task of leading the oppressed and exploited masses by the vanguard of these masses—
by the proletariat, as the most united and most politically conscious core
of the Soviets.
“The experience of all revolutions and of all movements of the
oppressed classes, the experience of the world socialist movement teaches
us,” says Lenin, “that the proletariat alone is able to unite and lead the scattered and backward strata of the toiling and exploited population.” (See
Vol. XXIV, p. 14.) The point is that the structure of Soviet power facilitates
23   All italics mine.—J. St.

45

The Foundations of Leninism

the practical application of the lessons drawn from this experience.
In that Soviet power, by combining legislative and executive power
in a single state organisation and replacing territorial electoral constituencies by industrial units, factories and mills, thereby directly links the
workers and the labouring masses in general with the apparatus of state
administration, teaches them how to govern the country.
In that Soviet power alone is capable of releasing the army from
its subordination to bourgeois command and of converting it from the
instrument of oppression of the people which it is under the bourgeois
order into an instrument for the liberation of the people from the yoke of
the bourgeoisie, both native and foreign.
In that “the Soviet organisation of the state alone is capable of immediately and effectively smashing and finally destroying the old, i.e., the
bourgeois, bureaucratic and judicial apparatus.” (Ibid.)
In that the Soviet form of state alone, by drawing the mass organisations of the toilers and exploited into constant and unrestricted participation in state administration, is capable of preparing the ground for the
withering away of the state, which is one of the basic elements of the future
stateless communist society.
The Republic of Soviets is thus the political form, so long sought
and finally discovered, within the framework of which the economic
emancipation of the proletariat, the complete victory of socialism, must
be accomplished.
The Paris Commune was the embryo of this form; Soviet power is its
development and culmination.
That is why Lenin says:
“The Republic of Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’, and
Peasants’ Deputies is not only the form of a higher type of
democratic institution... but is the only24 form capable of
ensuring the most painless transition to socialism.” (See Vol.
XXII, p. 131.)

5. The Peasant Question

Chapter V.

The Peasant Question
From this theme I take four questions:
a) the presentation of the question;
b) the peasantry during the bourgeois-democratic revolution;
c) the peasantry during the proletarian revolution;
d) the peasantry after the consolidation of Soviet power.
1) The presentation of the question. Some think that the fundamental
thing in Leninism is the peasant question, that the point of departure of
Leninism is the question of the peasantry, of its role, its relative importance. This is absolutely wrong. The fundamental question of Leninism,
its point of departure, is not the peasant question, but the question of the
dictatorship of the proletariat, of the conditions under which it can be
achieved, of the conditions under which it can be consolidated. The peasant question, as the question of the ally of the proletariat in its struggle for
power, is a derivative question.
This circumstance, however, does not in the least deprive the peasant
question of the serious and vital importance it unquestionably has for the
proletarian revolution. It is known that the serious study of the peasant
question in the ranks of Russian Marxists began precisely on the eve of
the first revolution (1905), when the question of overthrowing tsarism
and of realising the hegemony of the proletariat confronted the Party in
all its magnitude, and when the question of the ally of the proletariat in
the impending bourgeois revolution became of vital importance. It is also
known that the peasant question in Russia assumed a still more urgent
character during the proletarian revolution, when the question of the dictatorship of the proletariat, of achieving and maintaining it, led to the
question of allies for the proletariat in the impending proletarian revolution. And this was natural. Those who are marching towards and preparing
to assume power cannot but be interested in the question of who are their
real allies.
In this sense the peasant question is part of the general question of
the dictatorship of the proletariat, and as such it is one of the most vital
47

The Foundations of Leninism

problems of Leninism.
The attitude of indifference and sometimes even of outright aversion
displayed by the parties of the Second International towards the peasant
question is to be explained not only by the specific conditions of development in the West. It is to be explained primarily by the fact that these
parties do not believe in the proletarian dictatorship, that they fear revolution and have no intention of leading the proletariat to power. And those
who are afraid of revolution, who do not intend to lead the proletarians to
power, cannot be interested in the question of allies for the proletariat in
the revolution—to them the question of allies is one of indifference, of no
immediate significance. The ironical attitude of the heroes of the Second
International towards the peasant question is regarded by them as a sign of
good breeding, a sign of “true” Marxism. As a matter of fact, there is not
a grain of Marxism in this, for indifference towards so important a question as the peasant question on the eve of the proletarian revolution is the
reverse side of the repudiation of the dictatorship of the proletariat, it is an
unmistakable sign of downright betrayal of Marxism.
The question is as follows: Are the revolutionary potentialities latent
in the peasantry by virtue of certain conditions of its existence already
exhausted, or not; and if not, is there any hope, any basis, for utilising these
potentialities for the proletarian revolution, for transforming the peasantry,
the exploited majority of it, from the reserve of the bourgeoisie which it
was during the bourgeois revolutions in the West and still is even now, into
a reserve of the proletariat, into its ally?
Leninism replies to this question in the affirmative, i.e., it recognises
the existence of revolutionary capacities in the ranks of the majority of the
peasantry, and the possibility of using these in the interests of the proletarian dictatorship.
The history of the three revolutions in Russia fully corroborates the
conclusions of Leninism on this score.
Hence the practical conclusion that the toiling masses of the peasantry must be supported in their struggle against bondage and exploitation, in their struggle for deliverance from oppression and poverty. This
does not mean, of course, that the proletariat must support every peasant
movement. What we have in mind here is support for a movement or
struggle of the peasantry which, directly or indirectly, facilitates the eman48

5. The Peasant Question

cipation movement of the proletariat, which, in one way or another, brings
grist to the mill of the proletarian revolution, and which helps to transform the peasantry into a reserve and ally of the working class.
2) The peasantry during the bourgeois-democratic revolution. This
period extends from the first Russian revolution (1905) to the second
revolution (February 1917), inclusive. The characteristic feature of this
period is the emancipation of the peasantry from the influence of the liberal bourgeoisie, the peasantry’s desertion of the Cadets, its turn towards
the proletariat, towards the Bolshevik Party. The history of this period
is the history of the struggle between the Cadets (the liberal bourgeoisie) and the Bolsheviks (the proletariat) for the peasantry. The outcome of
this struggle was decided by the Duma period, for the period of the four
Dumas served as an object lesson to the peasantry, and this lesson brought
home to the peasantry the fact that they would receive neither land nor
liberty at the hands of the Cadets; that the tsar was wholly in favour of the
landlords, and that the Cadets were supporting the tsar; that the only force
they could rely on for assistance was the urban workers, the proletariat.
The imperialist war merely confirmed the lessons of the Duma period and
consummated the peasantry’s desertion of the bourgeoisie, consummated
the isolation of the liberal bourgeoisie; for the years of the war revealed the
utter futility, the utter deceptiveness of all hopes of obtaining peace from
the tsar and his bourgeois allies. Without the object lessons of the Duma
period, the hegemony of the proletariat would have been impossible.
That is how the alliance between the workers and the peasants in the
bourgeois-democratic revolution took shape. That is how the hegemony
(leadership) of the proletariat in the common struggle for the overthrow of
tsarism took shape—the hegemony which led to the February Revolution
of 1917.
The bourgeois revolutions in the West (Britain, France, Germany,
Austria) took, as is well known, a different road. There, hegemony in the
revolution belonged not to the proletariat, which by reason of its weakness
did not and could not represent an independent political force, but to the
liberal bourgeoisie. There the peasantry obtained its emancipation from
feudal regimes, not at the hands of the proletariat, which was numerically weak and unorganised, but at the hands of the bourgeoisie. There the
peasantry marched against the old order side by side with the liberal bour49

The Foundations of Leninism

geoisie. There the peasantry acted as the reserve of the bourgeoisie. There
the revolution, in consequence of this, led to an enormous increase in the
political weight of the bourgeoisie.
In Russia, on the contrary, the bourgeois revolution produced quite
opposite results. The revolution in Russia led not to the strengthening, but
to the weakening of the bourgeoisie as a political force, not to an increase
in its political reserves, but to the loss of its main reserve, to the loss of the
peasantry. The bourgeois revolution in Russia brought to the forefront not
the liberal bourgeoisie but the revolutionary proletariat, rallying around
the latter the millions of the peasantry.
Incidentally, this explains why the bourgeois revolution in Russia
passed into a proletarian revolution in a comparatively short space of time.
The hegemony of the proletariat was the embryo of, and the transitional
stage to, the dictatorship of the proletariat.
How is this peculiar phenomenon of the Russian revolution, which
has no precedent in the history of the bourgeois revolutions of the West,
to be explained? Whence this peculiarity?
It is to be explained by the fact that the bourgeois revolution
unfolded in Russia under more advanced conditions of class struggle than
in the West; that the Russian proletariat had at that time already become
an independent political force, whereas the liberal bourgeoisie, frightened
by the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, lost all semblance of revolutionary spirit (especially after the lessons of 1905) and turned towards an
alliance with the tsar and the landlords against the revolution, against the
workers and peasants.
We should bear in mind the following circumstances, which determined the peculiar character of the Russian bourgeois revolution.
a) The unprecedented concentration of Russian industry on the eve
of the revolution. It is known, for instance, that in Russia 54 per cent of
all the workers were employed in enterprises employing over 500 workers
each, whereas in so highly developed a country as the United States of
America no more than 33 per cent of all the workers were employed in
such enterprises. It scarcely needs proof that this circumstance alone, in
view of the existence of a revolutionary party like the Party of the Bolsheviks, transformed the working class of Russia into an immense force in the
political life of the country.
50

5. The Peasant Question

b) The hideous forms of exploitation in the factories, coupled with
the intolerable police regime of the tsarist henchmen—a circumstance
which transformed every important strike of the workers into an imposing
political action and steeled the working class as a force that was revolutionary to the end.
c) The political flabbiness of the Russian bourgeoisie, which after the
Revolution of 1905 turned into servility to tsarism and downright counter-revolution—a fact to be explained not only by the revolutionary spirit
of the Russian proletariat, which flung the Russian bourgeoisie into the
embrace of tsarism, but also by the direct dependence of this bourgeoisie
upon government contracts.
d) The existence in the countryside of the most hideous and most
intolerable survivals of serfdom, coupled with the unlimited power of the
landlords—a circumstance which threw the peasantry into the embrace of
the revolution.
e) Tsarism, which stifled everything that was alive, and whose tyranny aggravated the oppression of the capitalist and the landlord—a circumstance which united the struggle of the workers and peasants into a
single torrent of revolution.
f ) The imperialist war, which fused all these contradictions in the
political life of Russia into a profound revolutionary crisis, and which lent
the revolution tremendous striking force.
To whom could the peasantry turn under these circumstances? From
whom could it seek support against the unlimited power of the landlords, against the tyranny of the tsar, against the devastating war which
was ruining it? From the liberal bourgeoisie? But it was an enemy, as the
long years of experience of all four Dumas had proved. From the Socialist-Revolutionaries? The Socialist-Revolutionaries were “better” than the
Cadets, of course, and their programme was “suitable,” almost a peasant
programme; but what could the Socialist-Revolutionaries offer, considering that they thought of relying only on the peasants and were weak in the
towns, from which the enemy primarily drew its forces? Where was the
new force which would stop at nothing either in town or country, which
would boldly march in the front ranks to fight the tsar and the landlords,
which would help the peasantry to extricate itself from bondage, from
land hunger, from oppression, from war? Was there such a force in Rus51

The Foundations of Leninism

sia at all? Yes, there was. It was the Russian proletariat, which had shown
its strength, its ability to fight to the end, its boldness and revolutionary
spirit, as far back as 1905.
At any rate, there was no other such force; nor could any other be
found anywhere.
That is why the peasantry, when it turned its back on the Cadets and
attached itself to the Socialist-Revolutionaries, at the same time came to
realise the necessity of submitting to the leadership of such a courageous
leader of the revolution as the Russian proletariat.
Such were the circumstances which determined the peculiar character of the Russian bourgeois revolution.
3) The peasantry during the proletarian revolution. This period extends
from the February Revolution of 1917 to the October Revolution of 1917.
This period is comparatively short, eight months in all; but from the point
of view of the political enlightenment and revolutionary training of the
masses these eight months can safely be put on a par with whole decades
of ordinary constitutional development, for they were eight months of
revolution. The characteristic feature of this period was the further revolutionisation of the peasantry, its disillusionment with the Socialist-Revolutionaries, the peasantry’s desertion of the Socialist-Revolutionaries, its new
turn towards a direct rally around the proletariat as the only consistently
revolutionary force, capable of leading the country to peace. The history of
this period is the history of the struggle between the Socialist-Revolutionaries (petty-bourgeois democracy) and the Bolsheviks (proletarian democracy) for the peasantry, to win over the majority of the peasantry. The
outcome of this struggle was decided by the coalition period, the Kerensky
period, the refusal of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Mensheviks to
confiscate the landlords’ land, the fight of the Socialist-Revolutionaries
and Mensheviks to continue the war, the June offensive at the front, the
introduction of capital punishment for soldiers, the Kornilov revolt.
Whereas before, in the preceding period, the basic question of the
revolution had been the overthrow of the tsar and of the power of the landlords, now, in the period following the February Revolution, when there
was no longer any tsar, and when the interminable war had exhausted the
economy of the country and utterly ruined the peasantry, the question
of liquidating the war became the main problem of the revolution. The
52

5. The Peasant Question

centre of gravity had manifestly shifted from purely internal questions to
the main question—the war. “End the war,” “Let’s get out of the war”—
such was the general outcry of the war-weary nation and primarily of the
peasantry.
But in order to get out of the war it was necessary to overthrow the
Provisional Government, it was necessary to overthrow the power of the
bourgeoisie, it was necessary to overthrow the power of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, for they, and they alone, were dragging out
the war to a “victorious finish.” Practically, there was no way of getting out
of the war except by overthrowing the bourgeoisie.
This was a new revolution, a proletarian revolution, for it ousted
from power the last group of the imperialist bourgeoisie, its extreme Left
wing, the Socialist-Revolutionary Party and the Mensheviks, in order to
set up a new, proletarian power, the power of the Soviets, in order to put
in power the party of the revolutionary proletariat, the Bolshevik Party,
the party of the revolutionary struggle against the imperialist war and for a
democratic peace. The majority of the peasantry supported the struggle of
the workers for peace, for the power of the Soviets.
There was no other way out for the peasantry. Nor could there be
any other way out.
Thus, the Kerensky period was a great object lesson for the toiling
masses of the peasantry, for it showed clearly that with the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks in power the country would not extricate
itself from the war, and the peasants would never get either land or liberty; that the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries differed from the
Cadets only in their honeyed phrases and false promises, while they actually pursued the same imperialist, Cadet policy; that the only power that
could lead the country on to the proper road was the power of the Soviets.
The further prolongation of the war merely confirmed the truth of this
lesson, spurred on the revolution, and drove millions of peasants and soldiers to rally directly around the proletarian revolution. The isolation of the
Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks became an incontrovertible fact.
Without the object lessons of the coalition period the dictatorship of the
proletariat would have been impossible.
Such were the circumstances which facilitated the process of the
bourgeois revolution passing into the proletarian revolution.
53

The Foundations of Leninism

That is how the dictatorship of the proletariat took shape in Russia.
4) The peasantry after the consolidation of Soviet power. Whereas
before, in the first period of the revolution, the main objective was the
overthrow of tsarism, and later, after the February Revolution, the primary
objective was to get out of the imperialist war by overthrowing the bourgeoisie, now, after the liquidation of the civil war and the consolidation of
Soviet power, questions of economic construction came to the forefront.
Strengthen and develop the nationalised industry; for this purpose link up
industry with peasant economy through state-regulated trade; replace the
surplus-appropriation system by the tax in kind so as, later on, by gradually lowering the tax in kind, to reduce matters to the exchange of products
of industry for the products of peasant farming; revive trade and develop
the co-operatives, drawing into them the vast masses of the peasantry—
this is how Lenin outlined the immediate tasks of economic construction
on the way to building the foundations of socialist economy.
It is said that this task may prove beyond the strength of a peasant country like Russia. Some sceptics even say that it is simply utopian,
impossible, for the peasantry is a peasantry—it consists of small producers,
and therefore cannot be of use in organising the foundations of socialist
production.
But the sceptics are mistaken, for they fail to take into account certain circumstances which in the present case are of decisive significance.
Let us examine the most important of these:
Firstly. The peasantry in the Soviet Union must not be confused
with the peasantry in the West. A peasantry that has been schooled in three
revolutions, that fought against the tsar and the power of the bourgeoisie
side by side with the proletariat and under the leadership of the proletariat,
a peasantry that has received land and peace at the hands of the proletarian
revolution and by reason of this has become the reserve of the proletariat—
such a peasantry cannot but be different from a peasantry which during
the bourgeois revolution fought under the leadership of the liberal bourgeoisie, which received land at the hands of that bourgeoisie, and in view
of this became the reserve of the bourgeoisie. It scarcely needs proof that
the Soviet peasantry, which has learnt to appreciate its political friendship
and political collaboration with the proletariat and which owes its freedom
to this friendship and collaboration, cannot but represent exceptionally
54

5. The Peasant Question

favourable material for economic collaboration with the proletariat.
Engels said that “the conquest of political power by the Socialist
Party has become a matter of the not too distant future,” that “in order
to conquer political power this party must first go from the towns to the
country, must become a power in the countryside.” (See Engels, The Peasant Question, 1911 ed.)25 He wrote this in the nineties of the last century,
having in mind the Western peasantry. Does it need proof that the Russian
Communists, after accomplishing an enormous amount of work in this
field in the course of three revolutions, have already succeeded in gaining
in the countryside an influence and backing the like of which our Western
comrades dare not even dream of? How can it be denied that this circumstance must decidedly facilitate the organisation of economic collaboration between the working class and the peasantry of Russia?
The sceptics maintain that the small peasants are a factor that is
incompatible with socialist construction. But listen to what Engels says
about the small peasants of the West:
“We are decidedly on the side of the small peasant; we
shall do everything at all permissible to make his lot more
bearable, to facilitate his transition to the co-operative should
he decide to do so, and even to make it possible for him to
remain on his small holding for a protracted length of time
to think the matter over, should he still be unable to bring
himself to this decision. We do this not only because we consider the small peasant who does his own work as virtually
belonging to us, but also in the direct interest of the Party.
The greater the number of peasants whom we can save from
being actually hurled down into the proletariat, whom we can
win to our side while they are still peasants, the more quickly
and easily the social transformation will be accomplished. It
will serve us nought to wait with this transformation until
capitalist production has developed everywhere to its utmost
consequences, until the last small handicraftsman and the last
25. Frederick Engels, “The Peasant Question in France and Germany” (Karl Marx and
Frederick Engels, Selected Works, Moscow, 1951, Vol. II, p. 382).

55

The Foundations of Leninism

small peasant have fallen victim to capitalist large-scale production. The material sacrifices to be made for this purpose in
the interest of the peasants and to be defrayed out of public
funds can, from the point of view of capitalist economy, be
viewed only as money thrown away, but it is nevertheless an
excellent investment because it will effect a perhaps tenfold
saving in the cost of the social reorganisation in general. In
this sense we can, therefore, afford to deal very liberally with
the peasants.” (Ibid.)
That is what Engels said, having in mind the Western peasantry.
But is it not clear that what Engels said can nowhere be realised so easily
and so completely as in the land of the dictatorship of the proletariat? Is it
not clear that only in Soviet Russia is it possible at once and to the fullest
extent for “the small peasant who does his own work” to come over to our
side, for the “material sacrifices” necessary for this to be made, and for the
necessary “liberality towards the peasants” to be displayed? Is it not clear
that these and similar measures for the benefit of the peasantry are already
being carried out in Russia? How can it be denied that this circumstance,
in its turn, must facilitate and advance the work of economic construction
in the land of the Soviets?
Secondly. Agriculture in Russia must not be confused with agriculture in the West. There, agriculture is developing along the ordinary
lines of capitalism, under conditions of profound differentiation among
the peasantry, with large landed estates and private capitalist latifundia
at one extreme and pauperism, destitution and wage slavery at the other.
Owing to this, disintegration and decay are quite natural there. Not so in
Russia. Here agriculture cannot develop along such a path, if for no other
reason than that the existence of Soviet power and the nationalisation of
the principal instruments and means of production preclude such a development. In Russia the development of agriculture must proceed along a
different path, along the path of organising millions of small and middle
peasants in co-operatives, along the path of developing in the countryside
a mass co-operative movement supported by the state by means of preferential credits. Lenin rightly pointed out in his articles on co-operation that
the development of agriculture in our country must proceed along a new
56

5. The Peasant Question

path, along the path of drawing the majority of the peasants into socialist
construction through the co-operatives, along the path of gradually introducing into agriculture the principles of collectivism, first in the sphere of
marketing and later in the sphere of production of agricultural products.
Of extreme interest in this respect are several new phenomena
observed in the countryside in connection with the work of the agricultural co-operatives. It is well known that new, large organisations have
sprung up within the Selskosoyuz,26 in different branches of agriculture,
such as production of flax, potatoes, butter, etc., which have a great future
before them. Of these, the Flax Centre, for instance, unites a whole network of peasant flax growers’ associations. The Flax Centre supplies the
peasants with seeds and implements; then it buys all the flax produced
by these peasants, disposes of it on the market on a large scale, guarantees
the peasants a share in the profits, and in this way links peasant economy
with state industry through the Selskosoyuz. What shall we call this form
of organisation of production? In my opinion, it is the domestic system of
large-scale state-socialist production in the sphere of agriculture. In speaking of the domestic system of state-socialist production I do so by analogy
with the domestic system under capitalism, let us say, in the textile industry, where the handicraftsmen received their raw material and tools from
the capitalist and turned over to him the entire product of their labour,
thus being in fact semi-wage earners working in their own homes. This
is one of numerous indices showing the path along which our agriculture
must develop. There is no need to mention here similar indices in other
branches of agriculture.
It scarcely needs proof that the vast majority of the peasantry will
eagerly take this new path of development, rejecting the path of private
capitalist latifundia and wage slavery, the path of destitution and ruin.
Here is what Lenin says about the path of development of our agriculture:
“State power over all large-scale means of production,
state power in the hands of the proletariat, the alliance of this
26. Selskosoyuz — the All-Russian Union of Rural Co-operatives — existed from August
1921 to June 1929.

57

The Foundations of Leninism

proletariat with the many millions of small and very small
peasants, the assured leadership of the peasantry by the proletariat, etc.—is not this all that is necessary for building a
complete socialist society from the co-operatives, from the
co-operatives alone, which we formerly looked down upon as
huckstering and which from a certain aspect we have the right
to look down upon as such now, under the NEP? Is this not
all that is necessary for building a complete socialist society?
This is not yet the building of socialist society, but it is all that
is necessary and sufficient for this building.” (See Vol. XXVII,
p. 392.)
Further on, speaking of the necessity of giving financial and other
assistance to the co-operatives, as a “new principal of organising the population” and a new “social system” under the dictatorship of the proletariat,
Lenin continues:
“Every social system arises only with the financial assistance of a definite class. There is no need to mention the hundreds and hundreds of millions of rubles that the birth of ‘free’
capitalism cost. Now we must realise, and apply in our practical work, the fact that the social system which we must now
give more than usual assistance is the co-operative system. But
it must be assisted in the real sense of the word, i.e., it will
not be enough to interpret assistance to mean assistance for
any kind of co-operative trade; by assistance we must mean
assistance for co-operative trade in which really large masses of
the population really take part.” (Ibid., p. 393.)
What do all these facts prove?
That the sceptics are wrong.
That Leninism is right in regarding the masses of labouring peasants
as the reserve of the proletariat.
That the proletariat in power can and must use this reserve in order
to link industry with agriculture, to advance socialist construction, and to
provide for the dictatorship of the proletariat that necessary foundation
58

5. The Peasant Question

without which the transition to socialist economy is impossible.

59

6. The National Question

Chapter VI.

The National Question
From this theme I take two main questions:
a) the presentation of the question;
b) the liberation movement of the oppressed peoples and the proletarian revolution.
1) The presentation of the question. During the last two decades the
national question has undergone a number of very important changes.
The national question in the period of the Second International and the
national question in the period of Leninism are far from being the same
thing. They differ profoundly from each other, not only in their scope, but
also in their intrinsic character.
Formerly, the national question was usually confined to a narrow circle of questions, concerning, primarily, “civilised” nationalities. The Irish,
the Hungarians, the Poles, the Finns, the Serbs, and several other European
nationalities—that was the circle of unequal peoples in whose destinies the
leaders of the Second International were interested. The scores and hundreds of millions of Asiatic and African peoples who are suffering national
oppression in its most savage and cruel form usually remained outside of
their field of vision. They hesitated to put white and black, “civilised” and
“uncivilised” on the same plane. Two or three meaningless, lukewarm resolutions, which carefully evaded the question of liberating the colonies—
that was all the leaders of the Second International could boast of. Now
we can say that this duplicity and half-heartedness in dealing with the
national question has been brought to an end. Leninism laid bare this crying incongruity, broke down the wall between whites and blacks, between
Europeans and Asiatics, between the “civilised” and “uncivilised” slaves of
imperialism, and thus linked the national question with the question of
the colonies. The national question was thereby transformed from a particular and internal state problem into a general and international problem,
into a world problem of emancipating the oppressed peoples in the dependent countries and colonies from the yoke of imperialism.
Formerly, the principle of self-determination of nations was usually
61

The Foundations of Leninism

misinterpreted, and not infrequently it was narrowed down to the idea of
the right of nations to autonomy. Certain leaders of the Second International even went so far as to turn the right to self-determination into the
right to cultural autonomy, i.e., the right of oppressed nations to have
their own cultural institutions, leaving all political power in the hands of
the ruling nation. As a consequence, the idea of self-determination stood
in danger of being transformed from an instrument for combating annexations into an instrument for justifying them. Now we can say that this
confusion has been cleared up. Leninism broadened the conception of
self-determination, interpreting it as the right of the oppressed peoples of
the dependent countries and colonies to complete secession, as the right of
nations to independent existence as states. This precluded the possibility
of justifying annexations by interpreting the right to self-determination
as the right to autonomy. Thus, the principle of self-determination itself
was transformed from an instrument for deceiving the masses, which it
undoubtedly was in the hands of the social-chauvinists during the imperialist war, into an instrument for exposing all imperialist aspirations and
chauvinist machinations, into an instrument for the political education of
the masses in the spirit of internationalism.
Formerly, the question of the oppressed nations was usually regarded
as purely a juridical question. Solemn proclamations about “national equality of rights,” innumerable declarations about the “equality of nations”—
that was the stock-in-trade of the parties of the Second International,
which glossed over the fact that “equality of nations” under imperialism,
where one group of nations (a minority) lives by exploiting another group
of nations, is sheer mockery of the oppressed nations. Now we can say
that this bourgeois-juridical point of view on the national question has
been exposed. Leninism brought the national question down from the
lofty heights of high-sounding declarations to solid ground, and declared
that pronouncements about the “equality of nations” not backed by the
direct support of the proletarian parties for the liberation struggle of the
oppressed nations are meaningless and false. In this way the question of
the oppressed nations became one of supporting the oppressed nations, of
rendering real and continuous assistance to them in their struggle against
imperialism for real equality of nations, for their independent existence as
states.
62

6. The National Question

Formerly, the national question was regarded from a reformist point
of view, as an independent question having no connection with the general
question of the power of capital, of the overthrow of imperialism, of the
proletarian revolution. It was tacitly assumed that the victory of the proletariat in Europe was possible without a direct alliance with the liberation
movement in the colonies, that the national-colonial question could be
solved on the quiet, “of its own accord,” off the highway of the proletarian
revolution, without a revolutionary struggle against imperialism. Now we
can say that this anti-revolutionary point of view has been exposed. Leninism has proved, and the imperialist war and the revolution in Russia have
confirmed, that the national question can be solved only in connection
with and on the basis of the proletarian revolution, and that the road to
victory of the revolution in the West lies through the revolutionary alliance
with the liberation movement of the colonies and dependent countries
against imperialism. The national question is a part of the general question
of the proletarian revolution, a part of the question of the dictatorship of
the proletariat.
The question is as follows: Are the revolutionary potentialities
latent in the revolutionary liberation movement of the oppressed countries already exhausted, or not; and if not, is there any hope, any basis, for
utilising these potentialities for the proletarian revolution, for transforming the dependent and colonial countries from a reserve of the imperialist
bourgeoisie into a reserve of the revolutionary proletariat, into an ally of
the latter?
Leninism replies to this question in the affirmative, i.e., it recognises the existence of revolutionary capacities in the national liberation
movement of the oppressed countries, and the possibility of using these
for overthrowing the common enemy, for overthrowing imperialism. The
mechanics of the development of imperialism, the imperialist war and the
revolution in Russia wholly confirm the conclusions of Leninism on this
score.
Hence the necessity for the proletariat of the “dominant” nations
to support—resolutely and actively to support—the national liberation
movement of the oppressed and dependent peoples.
This does not mean, of course, that the proletariat must support every
national movement, everywhere and always, in every individual concrete
63

The Foundations of Leninism

case. It means that support must be given to such national movements
as tend to weaken, to overthrow imperialism, and not to strengthen and
preserve it. Cases occur when the national movements in certain oppressed
countries come into conflict with the interests of the development of the
proletarian movement. In such cases support is, of course, entirely out
of the question. The question of the rights of nations is not an isolated,
self-sufficient question; it is a part of the general problem of the proletarian revolution, subordinate to the whole, and must be considered from
the point of view of the whole. In the forties of the last century Marx
supported the national movement of the Poles and Hungarians and was
opposed to the national movement of the Czechs and the South Slavs.
Why? Because the Czechs and the South Slavs were then “reactionary peoples,” “Russian outposts” in Europe, outposts of absolutism; whereas the
Poles and the Hungarians were “revolutionary peoples,” fighting against
absolutism. Because support of the national movement of the Czechs and
the South Slavs was at that time equivalent to indirect support for tsarism,
the most dangerous enemy of the revolutionary movement in Europe.
“The various demands of democracy,” writes Lenin,
“including self-determination, are not an absolute, but a small
part of the general democratic (now: general socialist) world
movement. In individual concrete cases, the part may contradict the whole; if so, it must be rejected.” (See Vol. XIX, pp.
257-58.)
This is the position in regard to the question of particular national
movements, of the possible reactionary character of these movements—if,
of course, they are appraised not from the formal point of view, not from
the point of view of abstract rights, but concretely, from the point of view
of the interests of the revolutionary movement.
The same must be said of the revolutionary character of national
movements in general. The unquestionably revolutionary character of the
vast majority of national movements is as relative and peculiar as is the
possible reactionary character of certain particular national movements.
The revolutionary character of a national movement under the conditions
of imperialist oppression does not necessarily presuppose the existence of
64

6. The National Question

proletarian elements in the movement, the existence of a revolutionary or
a republican programme of the movement, the existence of a democratic
basis of the movement. The struggle that the Emir of Afghanistan is waging
for the independence of Afghanistan is objectively a revolutionary struggle,
despite the monarchist views of the Emir and his associates, for it weakens,
disintegrates and undermines imperialism; whereas the struggle waged by
such “desperate” democrats and “Socialists,” “revolutionaries” and republicans as, for example, Kerensky and Tsereteli, Renaudel and Scheidemann,
Chernov and Dan, Henderson and Clynes, during the imperialist war was
a reactionary struggle, for its result was the embellishment, the strengthening, the victory, of imperialism. For the same reasons, the struggle that
the Egyptian merchants and bourgeois intellectuals are waging for the
independence of Egypt is objectively a revolutionary struggle, despite the
bourgeois origin and bourgeois title of the leaders of the Egyptian national
movement, despite the fact that they are opposed to socialism; whereas
the struggle that the British “Labour” Government is waging to preserve
Egypt’s dependent position is for the same reasons a reactionary struggle,
despite the proletarian origin and the proletarian title of the members of
that government, despite the fact that they are “for” socialism. There is
no need to mention the national movement in other, larger, colonial and
dependent countries, such as India and China, every step of which along
the road to liberation, even if it runs counter to the demands of formal
democracy, is a steam-hammer blow at imperialism, i.e., is undoubtedly a
revolutionary step.
Lenin was right in saying that the national movement of the
oppressed countries should be appraised not from the point of view of formal democracy, but from the point of view of the actual results, as shown
by the general balance sheet of the struggle against imperialism, that is to
say, “not in isolation, but on a world scale.” (See Vol. XIX, p. 257.)
2) The liberation movement of the oppressed peoples and the proletarian
revolution. In solving the national question Leninism proceeds from the
following theses:
a) the world is divided into two camps: the camp of a handful of
civilised nations, which possess finance capital and exploit the vast majority of the population of the globe; and the camp of the oppressed and
exploited peoples in the colonies and dependent countries, which consti65

The Foundations of Leninism

tute that majority;
b) the colonies and the dependent countries, oppressed and exploited
by finance capital, constitute a vast reserve and a very important source of
strength for imperialism;
c) the revolutionary struggle of the oppressed peoples in the dependent and colonial countries against imperialism is the only road that leads
to their emancipation from oppression and exploitation;
d) the most important colonial and dependent countries have
already taken the path of the national liberation movement, which cannot
but lead to the crisis of world capitalism;
e) the interests of the proletarian movement in the developed countries and of the national liberation movement in the colonies call for the
union of these two forms of the revolutionary movement into a common
front against the common enemy, against imperialism;
f ) the victory of the working class in the developed countries and
the liberation of the oppressed peoples from the yoke of imperialism are
impossible without the formation and the consolidation of a common revolutionary front;
g) the formation of a common revolutionary front is impossible
unless the proletariat of the oppressor nations renders direct and determined support to the liberation movement of the oppressed peoples
against the imperialism of its “own country,” for “no nation can be free if
it oppresses other nations” (Engels);
h) this support implies the upholding, defence and implementation
of the slogan of the right of nations to secession, to independent existence
as states;
i) unless this slogan is implemented, the union and collaboration of
nations within a single world economic system, which is the material basis
for the victory of world socialism, cannot be brought about;
j) this union can only be voluntary, arising on the basis of mutual
confidence and fraternal relations among peoples.
Hence the two sides, the two tendencies in the national question:
the tendency towards political emancipation from the shackles of imperialism and towards the formation of an independent national state—a tendency which arose as a consequence of imperialist oppression and colonial
exploitation; and the tendency towards closer economic relations among
66

6. The National Question

nations, which arose as a result of the formation of a world market and a
world economic system.
“Developing capitalism,” says Lenin, “knows two historical tendencies in the national question. First: the awakening of national life and national movements, struggle against
all national oppression, creation of national states. Second:
development and acceleration of all kinds of intercourse
between nations, breakdown of national barriers, creation of
the international unity of capital, of economic life in general,
of politics, science, etc.
“Both tendencies are a world-wide law of capitalism.
The first predominates at the beginning of its development,
the second characterises mature capitalism that is moving
towards its transformation into socialist society.” (See Vol.
XVII, pp. 139-40.)
For imperialism these two tendencies represent irreconcilable contradictions; because imperialism cannot exist without exploiting colonies
and forcibly retaining them within the framework of the “integral whole”;
because imperialism can bring nations together only by means of annexations and colonial conquest, without which imperialism is, generally
speaking, inconceivable.
For communism, on the contrary, these tendencies are but two sides
of a single cause—the cause of the emancipation of the oppressed peoples
from the yoke of imperialism; because communism knows that the union
of peoples in a single world economic system is possible only on the basis
of mutual confidence and voluntary agreement, and that the road to the
formation of a voluntary union of peoples lies through the separation of
the colonies from the “integral” imperialist “whole,” through the transformation of the colonies into independent states.
Hence the necessity for a stubborn, continuous and determined
struggle against the dominant-nation chauvinism of the “Socialists” of the
ruling nations (Britain, France, America, Italy, Japan, etc.), who do not
want to fight their imperialist governments, who do not want to support
the struggle of the oppressed peoples in “their” colonies for emancipation
67

The Foundations of Leninism

from oppression, for secession.
Without such a struggle the education of the working class of the
ruling nations in the spirit of true internationalism, in the spirit of closer
relations with the toiling masses of the dependent countries and colonies,
in the spirit of real preparation for the proletarian revolution, is inconceivable. The revolution would not have been victorious in Russia, and
Kolchak and Denikin would not have been crushed, had not the Russian
proletariat enjoyed the sympathy and support of the oppressed peoples of
the former Russian Empire. But to win the sympathy and support of these
peoples it had first of all to break the fetters of Russian imperialism and
free these peoples from the yoke of national oppression.
Without this it would have been impossible to consolidate Soviet
power, to implant real internationalism and to create that remarkable
organisation for the collaboration of peoples which is called the Union of
Soviet Socialist Republics, and which is the living prototype of the future
union of peoples in a single world economic system.
Hence the necessity of fighting against the national isolationism,
narrowness and aloofness of the Socialists in the oppressed countries, who
do not want to rise above their national parochialism and who do not
understand the connection between the liberation movement in their own
countries and the proletarian movement in the ruling countries.
Without such a struggle it is inconceivable that the proletariat of
the oppressed nations can maintain an independent policy and its class
solidarity with the proletariat of the ruling countries in the fight for the
overthrow of the common enemy, in the fight for the overthrow of imperialism.
Without such a struggle, internationalism would be impossible.
Such is the way in which the toiling masses of the dominant and
of the oppressed nations must be educated in the spirit of revolutionary
internationalism.
Here is what Lenin says about this twofold task of communism in
educating the workers in the spirit of internationalism:
“Can such education… be concretely identical in great,
oppressing nations and in small, oppressed nations, in annexing nations and in annexed nations?

“Obviously not. The way to the one goal—to complete
equality, to the closest relations and the subsequent amalgamation of all nations—obviously proceeds here by different
routes in each concrete case; in the same way, let us say, as
the route to a point in the middle of a given page lies towards
the left from one edge and towards the right from the opposite edge. If a Social-Democrat belonging to a great, oppressing, annexing nation, while advocating the amalgamation
of nations in general, were to forget even for one moment
that ‘his’ Nicholas II, ‘his’ Wilhelm, George, Poincare, etc.,
also stands for amalgamation with small nations (by means
of annexations)—Nicholas II being for ‘amalgamation’ with
Galicia, Wilhelm II for ‘amalgamation’ with Belgium, etc.—
such a Social-Democrat would be a ridiculous doctrinaire in
theory and an abettor of imperialism in practice.
“The weight of emphasis in the internationalist education of the workers in the oppressing countries must necessarily consist in their advocating and upholding freedom of
secession for oppressed countries. Without this there can be
no internationalism. It is our right and duty to treat every
Social-Democrat of an oppressing nation who fails to conduct
such propaganda as an imperialist and a scoundrel. This is an
absolute demand, even if the chance of secession being possible and ‘feasible’ before the introduction of socialism be only
one in a thousand...
“On the other hand, a Social-Democrat belonging to a
small nation must emphasise in his agitation the second word
of our general formula: ‘voluntary union’ of nations. He may,
without violating his duties as an internationalist, be in favour
of either the political independence of his nation or its inclusion in a neighbouring state X, Y, Z, etc. But in all cases he
must fight against small-nation narrow-mindedness, isolationism and aloofness, he must fight for the recognition of the
whole and the general, for the subordination of the interests
of the particular to the interests of the general.
“People who have not gone thoroughly into the ques69

The Foundations of Leninism

tion think there is a ‘contradiction’ in Social-Democrats of
oppressing nations insisting on ‘freedom of secession,’ while
Social-Democrats of oppressed nations insist on ‘freedom of
union.’ However, a little reflection will show that there is not,
and cannot be, any other road leading from the given situation
to internationalism and the amalgamation of nations, any
other road to this goal.” (See Vol. XIX, pp. 261-62.)

7. Strategy and Tactics

Chapter VII.

Strategy and Tactics
From this theme I take six questions:
a) strategy and tactics as the science of leadership in the class struggle
of the proletariat;
b) stages of the revolution, and strategy;
c) the flow and ebb of the movement, and tactics;
d) strategic leadership;
e) tactical leadership;
f ) reformism and revolutionism.
1) Strategy and tactics as the science of leadership in the class struggle of
the proletariat. The period of the domination of the Second International
was mainly a period of the formation and training of the proletarian political armies under conditions of more or less peaceful development. It was
the period of parliamentarism as the predominant form of the class struggle. Questions of great class conflicts, of preparing the proletariat for revolutionary clashes, of the means of achieving the dictatorship of the proletariat, did not seem to be on the order of the day at that time. The task
was confined to utilising all means of legal development for the purpose of
forming and training the proletarian armies, to utilising parliamentarism
in conformity with the conditions under which the status of the proletariat remained, and, as it seemed, had to remain, that of an opposition. It
scarcely needs proof that in such a period and with such a conception of
the tasks of the proletariat there could be neither an integral strategy nor
any elaborated tactics. There were fragmentary and detached ideas about
tactics and strategy, but no tactics or strategy as such.
The mortal sin of the Second International was not that it pursued at
that time the tactics of utilising parliamentary forms of struggle, but that
it overestimated the importance of these forms, that it considered them
virtually the only forms; and that when the period of open revolutionary
battles set in and the question of extra-parliamentary forms of struggle
came to the fore, the parties of the Second International turned their backs
on these new tasks, refused to shoulder them.
71

The Foundations of Leninism

Only in the subsequent period, the period of direct action by the
proletariat, the period of proletarian revolution, when the question of
overthrowing the bourgeoisie became a question of immediate practical action; when the question of the reserves of the proletariat (strategy)
became one of the most burning questions; when all forms of struggle
and of organisation, parliamentary and extra-parliamentary (tactics), had
quite clearly manifested themselves—only in this period could an integral
strategy and elaborated tactics for the struggle of the proletariat be worked
out. It was precisely in this period that Lenin brought out into the light
of day the brilliant ideas of Marx and Engels on tactics and strategy that
had been suppressed by the opportunists of the Second International. But
Lenin did not confine himself to restoring particular tactical propositions
of Marx and Engels. He developed them further and supplemented them
with new ideas and propositions, combining them all into a system of
rules and guiding principles for the leadership of the class struggle of the
proletariat. Lenin’s pamphlets, such as What Is To Be Done?, Two Tactics,
Imperialism, The State and Revolution, The Proletarian Revolution and the
Renegade Kautsky, “Left-Wing” Communism, undoubtedly constitute priceless contributions to the general treasury of Marxism, to its revolutionary
arsenal. The strategy and tactics of Leninism constitute the science of leadership in the revolutionary struggle of the proletariat.
2) Stages of the revolution, and strategy. Strategy is the determination
of the direction of the main blow of the proletariat at a given stage of the
revolution, the elaboration of a corresponding plan for the disposition of
the revolutionary forces (main and secondary reserves), the fight to carry
out this plan throughout the given stage of the revolution.
Our revolution had already passed through two stages, and after the
October Revolution it entered a third one. Our strategy changed accordingly.
First stage. 1903 to February 1917. Objective: to overthrow tsarism
and completely wipe out the survivals of medievalism. The main force of
the revolution: the proletariat. Immediate reserves: the peasantry. Direction of the main blow: the isolation of the liberal-monarchist bourgeoisie,
which was striving to win over the peasantry and liquidate the revolution
by a compromise with tsarism. Plan for the disposition of forces: alliance
of the working class with the peasantry. “The proletariat must carry to
72

7. Strategy and Tactics

completion the democratic revolution, by allying to itself the mass of the
peasantry in order to crush by force the resistance of the autocracy and to
paralyse the instability of the bourgeoisie.” (See Lenin, Vol. VIII, p. 96.)
Second stage. March 1917 to October 1917. Objective: to overthrow
imperialism in Russia and to withdraw from the imperialist war. The main
force of the revolution: the proletariat. Immediate reserves: the poor peasantry. The proletariat of neighbouring countries as probable reserves. The
protracted war and the crisis of imperialism as a favourable factor. Direction of the main blow: isolation of the petty-bourgeois democrats (Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries), who were striving to win over the
toiling masses of the peasantry and to put an end to the revolution by a
compromise with imperialism. Plan for the disposition of forces: alliance of
the proletariat with the poor peasantry. “The proletariat must accomplish
the socialist revolution, by allying to itself the mass of the semi-proletarian
elements of the population in order to crush by force the resistance of the
bourgeoisie and to paralyse the instability of the peasantry and the petty
bourgeoisie” (ibid.).
Third stage. Began after the October Revolution. Objective: to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat in one country, using it as a
base for the defeat of imperialism in all countries. The revolution spreads
beyond the confines of one country; the epoch of world revolution has
begun. The main forces of the revolution: the dictatorship of the proletariat in one country, the revolutionary movement of the proletariat in all
countries. Main reserves: the semi-proletarian and small-peasant masses
in the developed countries, the liberation movement in the colonies and
dependent countries. Direction of the main blow: isolation of the petty-bourgeois democrats, isolation of the parties of the Second International, which constitute the main support of the policy of compromise with
imperialism. Plan for the disposition of forces: alliance of the proletarian
revolution with the liberation movement in the colonies and the dependent countries.
Strategy deals with the main forces of the revolution and their
reserves. It changes with the passing of the revolution from one stage to
another, but remains basically unchanged throughout a given stage.
3) The flow and ebb of the movement, and tactics. Tactics are the determination of the line of conduct of the proletariat in the comparatively
73

The Foundations of Leninism

short period of the flow or ebb of the movement, of the rise or decline of
the revolution, the fight to carry out this line by means of replacing old
forms of struggle and organisation by new ones, old slogans by new ones,
by combining these forms, etc. While the object of strategy is to win the
war against tsarism, let us say, or against the bourgeoisie, to carry through
the struggle against tsarism or against the bourgeoisie to its end, tactics
pursue less important objects, for their aim is not the winning of the war as
a whole, but the winning of some particular engagements or some particular battles, the carrying through successfully of some particular campaigns
or actions corresponding to the concrete circumstances in the given period
of rise or decline of the revolution. Tactics are a part of strategy, subordinate to it and serving it.
Tactics change according to flow and ebb. While the strategic
plan remained unchanged during the first stage of the revolution (1903
to February 1917), tactics changed several times during that period. In
the period from 1903 to 1905 the Party pursued offensive tactics, for the
tide of the revolution was rising, the movement was on the upgrade, and
tactics had to proceed from this fact. Accordingly, the forms of struggle
were revolutionary, corresponding to the requirements of the rising tide
of the revolution. Local political strikes, political demonstrations, the general political strike, boycott of the Duma, uprising, revolutionary fighting
slogans—such were the successive forms of struggle during that period.
These changes in the forms of struggle were accompanied by corresponding changes in the forms of organisation. Factory committees, revolutionary peasant committees, strike committees, Soviets of workers’ deputies,
a workers’ party operating more or less openly—such were the forms of
organisation during that period.
In the period from 1907 to 1912 the Party was compelled to resort
to tactics of retreat; for we then experienced a decline in the revolutionary
movement, the ebb of the revolution, and tactics necessarily had to take
this fact into consideration. The forms of struggle, as well as the forms of
organisation, changed accordingly: instead of the boycott of the Duma—
participation in the Duma; instead of open revolutionary actions outside
the Duma—actions and work in the Duma; instead of general political
strikes—partial economic strikes, or simply a lull in activities. Of course,
the Party had to go underground during that period, while the revolution74

7. Strategy and Tactics

ary mass organisations were replaced by cultural, educational, co-operative, insurance and other legal organisations.
The same must be said of the second and third stages of the revolution, during which tactics changed dozens of times, whereas the strategic
plans remained unchanged.
Tactics deal with the forms of struggle and the forms of organisation
of the proletariat, with their changes and combinations. During a given
stage of the revolution tactics may change several times, depending on the
flow or ebb, the rise or decline of the revolution.
4) Strategic leadership. The reserves of the revolution can be:
direct: a) the peasantry and in general the intermediate strata of the
population within the country; b) the proletariat of neighbouring countries; c) the revolutionary movement in the colonies and dependent countries; d) the conquests and gains of the dictatorship of the proletariat—part
of which the proletariat may give up temporarily, while retaining superiority of forces, in order to buy off a powerful enemy and gain a respite; and
indirect: a) the contradictions and conflicts among the non-proletarian classes within the country, which can be utilised by the proletariat to
weaken the enemy and to strengthen its own reserves; b) contradictions,
conflicts and wars (the imperialist war, for instance) among the bourgeois
states hostile to the proletarian state, which can be utilised by the proletariat in its offensive or in manoeuvring in the event of a forced retreat.
There is no need to speak at length about the reserves of the first
category, as their significance is clear to everyone. As for the reserves of the
second category, whose significance is not always clear, it must be said that
sometimes they are of prime importance for the progress of the revolution.
One can hardly deny the enormous importance, for example, of the conflict between the petty-bourgeois democrats (Socialist-Revolutionaries)
and the liberal-monarchist bourgeoisie (the Cadets) during and after the
first revolution, which undoubtedly played its part in freeing the peasantry
from the influence of the bourgeoisie. Still less reason is there for denying
the colossal importance of the fact that the principal groups of imperialists
were engaged in a deadly war during the period of the October Revolution,
when the imperialists, engrossed in war among themselves, were unable to
concentrate their forces against the young Soviet power, and the proletariat, for this very reason, was able to get down to the work of organising its
75

The Foundations of Leninism

forces and consolidating its power, and to prepare the rout of Kolchak and
Denikin. It must be presumed that now, when the contradictions among
the imperialist groups are becoming more and more profound, and when
a new war among them is becoming inevitable, reserves of this description
will assume ever greater importance for the proletariat.
The task of strategic leadership is to make proper use of all these
reserves for the achievement of the main object of the revolution at the
given stage of its development.
What does making proper use of reserves mean?
It means fulfilling certain necessary conditions, of which the following must be regarded as the principal ones:
Firstly. The concentration of the main forces of the revolution at the
enemy’s most vulnerable spot at the decisive moment, when the revolution
has already become ripe, when the offensive is going full-steam ahead,
when insurrection is knocking at the door, and when bringing the reserves
up to the vanguard is the decisive condition of success. The Party’s strategy
during the period from April to October 1917 can be taken as an example
of this manner of utilising reserves. Undoubtedly, the enemy’s most vulnerable spot at that time was the war. Undoubtedly, it was on this question, as the fundamental one, that the Party rallied the broadest masses
of the population around the proletarian vanguard. The Party’s strategy
during that period was, while training the vanguard for street action by
means of manifestations and demonstrations, to bring the reserves up to
the vanguard through the medium of the Soviets in the rear and the soldiers’ committees at the front. The outcome of the revolution has shown
that the reserves were properly utilised.
Here is what Lenin, paraphrasing the well-known theses of Marx
and Engels on insurrection, says about this condition of the strategic utilisation of the forces of the revolution:
“1) Never play with insurrection, but when beginning it
firmly realise that you must go to the end.
“2) Concentrate a great superiority of forces at the decisive point, at the decisive moment, otherwise the enemy, who
has the advantage of better preparation and organisation, will
destroy the insurgents.
76

7. Strategy and Tactics

“3) Once the insurrection has begun, you must act with
the greatest determination, and by all means, without fail, take
the offensive. ‘The defensive is the death of every armed rising.’
“4) You must try to take the enemy by surprise and seize
the moment when his forces are scattered.
“5) You must strive for daily successes, even if small (one
might say hourly, if it is the case of one town), and at all costs
retain the ‘moral ascendancy’.” (See Vol. XXI, pp. 319-20.)
Secondly. The selection of the moment for the decisive blow, of the
moment for starting the insurrection, so timed as to coincide with the
moment when the crisis has reached its climax, when it is already the case
that the vanguard is prepared to fight to the end, the reserves are prepared
to support the vanguard, and maximum consternation reigns in the ranks
of the enemy.
The decisive battle, says Lenin, may be deemed to have
fully matured if “(1) all the class forces hostile to us have
become sufficiently entangled, are sufficiently at loggerheads,
have sufficiently weakened themselves in a struggle which is
beyond their strength”; if “(2) all the vacillating, wavering,
unstable, intermediate elements—the petty bourgeoisie, the
petty-bourgeois democrats as distinct from the bourgeoisie—
have sufficiently exposed themselves in the eyes of the people,
have sufficiently disgraced themselves through their practical
bankruptcy”; if “(3) among the proletariat a mass sentiment
in favour of supporting the most determined, supremely
bold, revolutionary action against the bourgeoisie has arisen
and begun vigorously to grow. Then revolution is indeed ripe;
then, indeed, if we have correctly gauged all the conditions
indicated above... and if we have chosen the moment rightly,
our victory is assured.” (See Vol. XXV, p. 229.)
The manner in which the October uprising was carried out may be
taken as a model of such strategy.
Failure to observe this condition leads to a dangerous error called
77

The Foundations of Leninism

“loss of tempo,” when the Party lags behind the movement or runs far
ahead of it, courting the danger of failure. An example of such “loss of
tempo,” of how the moment for an uprising should not be chosen, may be
seen in the attempt made by a section of our comrades to begin the uprising by arresting the Democratic Conference in September 1917, when
wavering was still apparent in the Soviets, when the armies at the front
were still at the crossroads, when the reserves had not yet been brought up
to the vanguard.
Thirdly. Undeviating pursuit of the course adopted, no matter what
difficulties and complications are encountered on the road towards the
goal; this is necessary in order that the vanguard may not lose sight of
the main goal of the struggle and that the masses may not stray from
the road while marching towards that goal and striving to rally around
the vanguard. Failure to observe this condition leads to a grave error, well
known to sailors as “losing one’s bearings.” As an example of this “losing
one’s bearings” we may take the erroneous conduct of our Party when,
immediately after the Democratic Conference, it adopted a resolution to
participate in the Pre-parliament. For the moment the Party, as it were,
forgot that the Pre-parliament was an attempt of the bourgeoisie to switch
the country from the path of the Soviets to the path of bourgeois parliamentarism, that the Party’s participation in such a body might result in
mixing everything up and confusing the workers and peasants, who were
waging a revolutionary struggle under the slogan: “All Power to the Soviets.” This mistake was rectified by the withdrawal of the Bolsheviks from
the Pre-parliament.
Fourthly. Manoeuvring the reserves with a view to effecting a proper
retreat when the enemy is strong, when retreat is inevitable, when to accept
battle forced upon us by the enemy is obviously disadvantageous, when,
with the given relation of forces, retreat becomes the only way to escape a
blow against the vanguard and to retain the reserves for the latter.
“The revolutionary parties,” says Lenin, “must complete
their education. They have learned to attack. Now they have
to realise that this knowledge must be supplemented with the
knowledge how to retreat properly. They have to realise—and
the revolutionary class is taught to realise it by its own bit78

7. Strategy and Tactics

ter experience—that victory is impossible unless they have
learned both how to attack and how to retreat properly.” (See
Vol. XXV, p. 177.)
The object of this strategy is to gain time, to disrupt the enemy, and
to accumulate forces in order later to assume the offensive.
The signing of the Brest Peace may be taken as a model of this strategy, for it enabled the Party to gain time, to take advantage of the conflicts
in the camp of the imperialists, to disrupt the forces of the enemy, to retain
the support of the peasantry, and to accumulate forces in preparation for
the offensive against Kolchak and Denikin.
“In concluding a separate peace,” said Lenin at that
time, “we free ourselves as much as is possible at the present
moment from both warring imperialist groups, we take advantage of their mutual enmity and warfare, which hinder them
from making a deal against us, and for a certain period have
our hands free to advance and to consolidate the socialist revolution.” (See Vol. XXII, p. 198.)
“Now even the biggest fool,” said Lenin three years after
the Brest Peace, can see “that the ‘Brest Peace’ was a concession that strengthened us and broke up the forces of international imperialism.” (See Vol. XXVII, p. 7.)
Such are the principal conditions which ensure correct strategic
leadership.
5) Tactical leadership. Tactical leadership is a part of strategic leadership, subordinated to the tasks and the requirements of the latter. The task
of tactical leadership is to master all forms of struggle and organisation of
the proletariat and to ensure that they are used properly so as to achieve,
with the given relation of forces, the maximum results necessary to prepare
for strategic success.
What is meant by making proper use of the forms of struggle and
organisation of the proletariat?
It means fulfilling certain necessary conditions, of which the following must be regarded as the principal ones:
79

The Foundations of Leninism

Firstly. To put in the forefront precisely those forms of struggle and
organisation which are best suited to the conditions prevailing during the
flow or ebb of the movement at a given moment, and which therefore
can facilitate and ensure the bringing of the masses to the revolutionary
positions, the bringing of the millions to the revolutionary front, and their
disposition at the revolutionary front.
The point here is not that the vanguard should realise the impossibility of preserving the old regime and the inevitability of its overthrow. The
point is that the masses, the millions, should understand this inevitability
and display their readiness to support the vanguard. But the masses can
understand this only from their own experience. The task is to enable the
vast masses to realise from their own experience the inevitability of the
overthrow of the old regime, to promote such methods of struggle and
forms of organisation as will make it easier for the masses to realise from
experience the correctness of the revolutionary slogans.
The vanguard would have become detached from the working class,
and the working class would have lost contact with the masses, if the Party
had not decided at the time to participate in the Duma, if it had not
decided to concentrate its forces on work in the Duma and to develop a
struggle on the basis of this work, in order to make it easier for the masses
to realise from their own experience the futility of the Duma, the falsity of
the promises of the Cadets, the impossibility of compromise with tsarism,
and the inevitability of an alliance between the peasantry and the working
class. Had the masses not gained their experience during the period of the
Duma, the exposure of the Cadets and the hegemony of the proletariat
would have been impossible.
The danger of the “Otzovist” tactics was that they threatened to
detach the vanguard from the millions of its reserves.
The Party would have become detached from the working class, and
the working class would have lost its influence among the broad masses of
the peasants and soldiers, if the proletariat had followed the “Left” Communists, who called for an uprising in April 1917, when the Mensheviks
and Socialist-Revolutionaries had not yet exposed themselves as advocates
of war and imperialism, when the masses had not yet realised from their
own experience the falsity of the speeches of the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries about peace, land and freedom. Had the masses not
80

7. Strategy and Tactics

gained this experience during the Kerensky period, the Mensheviks and
Socialist-Revolutionaries would not have been isolated and the dictatorship of the proletariat would have been impossible. Therefore, the tactics
of “patiently explaining” the mistakes of the petty-bourgeois parties and of
open struggle in the Soviets were the only correct tactics.
The danger of the tactics of the “Left” Communists was that they
threatened to transform the Party from the leader of the proletarian revolution into a handful of futile conspirators with no ground to stand on.
“Victory cannot be won with the vanguard alone,”
says Lenin. “To throw the vanguard alone into the decisive
battle, before the whole class, before the broad masses have
taken up a position either of direct support of the vanguard,
or at least of benevolent neutrality towards it... would be not
merely folly but a crime. And in order that actually the whole
class, that actually the broad masses of the working people
and those oppressed by capital may take up such a position,
propaganda and agitation alone are not enough. For this the
masses must have their own political experience. Such is the
fundamental law of all great revolutions, now confirmed with
astonishing force and vividness not only in Russia but also in
Germany. Not only the uncultured, often illiterate masses of
Russia, but the highly cultured, entirely literate masses of Germany had to realise through their own painful experience the
absolute impotence and spinelessness, the absolute helplessness and servility to the bourgeoisie, the utter vileness, of the
government of the knights of the Second International, the
absolute inevitability of a dictatorship of the extreme reactionaries (Kornilov in Russia, Kapp27 and Co. in Germany) as the
only alternative to a dictatorship of the proletariat, in order to
turn resolutely towards communism.” (See Vol. XXV, p. 228.)
27. Kapp (1868-1922) was the ringleader of the counter-revolutionary coup d’etat of
1920 in Germany, which was known as the “Kapp putsch.” He became the head of the
new government which was short-lived, being overthrown by the general strike of the
German workers.

81

The Foundations of Leninism

Secondly. To locate at any given moment the particular link in the
chain of processes which, if grasped, will enable us to keep hold of the
whole chain and to prepare the conditions for achieving strategic success.
The point here is to single out from all the tasks confronting the
Party the particular immediate task, the fulfilment of which constitutes
the central point, and the accomplishment of which ensures the successful
fulfilment of the other immediate tasks.
The importance of this thesis may be illustrated by two examples,
one of which could be taken from the remote past (the period of the formation of the Party) and the other from the immediate present (the period
of the NEP).
In the period of the formation of the Party, when the innumerable
circles and organisations had not yet been linked together, when amateurishness and the parochial outlook of the circles were corroding the Party
from top to bottom, when ideological confusion was the characteristic
feature of the internal life of the Party, the main link and the main task
in the chain of links and in the chain of tasks then confronting the Party
proved to be the establishment of an all-Russian illegal newspaper (Iskra).
Why? Because, under the conditions then prevailing, only by means of an
all-Russian illegal newspaper was it possible to create a solid core of the
Party capable of uniting the innumerable circles and organisations into
one whole, to prepare the conditions for ideological and tactical unity, and
thus to build the foundations for the formation of a real party.
During the period of transition from war to economic construction,
when industry was vegetating in the grip of disruption and agriculture was
suffering from a shortage of urban manufactured goods, when the establishment of a bond between state industry and peasant economy became
the fundamental condition for successful socialist construction—in that
period it turned out that the main link in the chain of processes, the main
task among a number of tasks, was to develop trade. Why? Because under
the conditions of the NEP the bond between industry and peasant economy cannot be established except through trade; because under the conditions of the NEP production without sale is fatal for industry; because
industry can be expanded only by the expansion of sales as a result of
developing trade; because only after we have consolidated our position in
the sphere of trade, only after we have secured control of trade, only after
82

7. Strategy and Tactics

we have secured this link can there be any hope of linking industry with
the peasant market and successfully fulfilling the other immediate tasks
in order to create the conditions for building the foundations of socialist
economy.
“It is not enough to be a revolutionary and an adherent
of socialism or a Communist in general,” says Lenin. “One
must be able at each particular moment to find the particular
link in the chain which one must grasp with all one’s might in
order to keep hold of the whole chain and to prepare firmly
for the transition to the next link.”...
“At the present time... this link is the revival of internal
trade under proper state regulation (direction). Trade—that is
the ‘link’ in the historical chain of events, in the transitional
forms of our socialist construction in 1921-22, ‘which we must
grasp with all our might’...” (See Vol. XXVII, p. 82.)
Such are the principal conditions which ensure correct tactical leadership.
6) Reformism and revolutionism. What is the difference between revolutionary tactics and reformist tactics?
Some think that Leninism is opposed to reforms, opposed to compromises and to agreements in general. This is absolutely wrong. Bolsheviks know as well as anybody else that in a certain sense “every little helps,”
that under certain conditions reforms in general, and compromises and
agreements in particular, are necessary and useful.
“To carry on a war for the overthrow of the international
bourgeoisie,” says Lenin, “a war which is a hundred times more
difficult, protracted and complicated than the most stubborn
of ordinary wars between states, and to refuse beforehand to
manoeuvre, to utilise the conflict of interests (even though
temporary) among one’s enemies, to reject agreements and
compromises with possible (even though temporary, unstable, vacillating and conditional) allies—is not this ridiculous
in the extreme? Is it not as though, when making a difficult
83

The Foundations of Leninism

ascent of an unexplored and hitherto inaccessible mountain,
we were to refuse beforehand ever to move in zigzags, ever to
retrace our steps, ever to abandon the course once selected and
to try others?” (See Vol. XXV, p. 210.)
Obviously, therefore, it is not a matter of reforms or of compromises
and agreements, but of the use people make of reforms and agreements.
To a reformist, reforms are everything, while revolutionary work is
something incidental, something just to talk about, mere eyewash. That is
why, with reformist tactics under the conditions of bourgeois rule, reforms
are inevitably transformed into an instrument for strengthening that rule,
an instrument for disintegrating the revolution.
To a revolutionary, on the contrary, the main thing is revolutionary
work and not reforms; to him reforms are a by-product of the revolution.
That is why, with revolutionary tactics under the conditions of bourgeois
rule, reforms are naturally transformed into an instrument for disintegrating that rule, into an instrument for strengthening the revolution, into a
strongpoint for the further development of the revolutionary movement.
The revolutionary will accept a reform in order to use it as an aid in
combining legal work with illegal work to intensify, under its cover, the
illegal work for the revolutionary preparation of the masses for the overthrow of the bourgeoisie.
That is the essence of making revolutionary use of reforms and agreements under the conditions of imperialism.
The reformist, on the contrary, will accept reforms in order to
renounce all illegal work, to thwart the preparation of the masses for the
revolution and to rest in the shade of “bestowed” reforms.
That is the essence of reformist tactics.
Such is the position in regard to reforms and agreements under the
conditions of imperialism.
The situation changes somewhat, however, after the overthrow of
imperialism, under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Under certain conditions, in a certain situation, the proletarian power may find itself compelled temporarily to leave the path of the revolutionary reconstruction
of the existing order of things and to take the path of its gradual transformation, the “reformist path,” as Lenin says in his well-known article “The
84

7. Strategy and Tactics

Importance of Gold,”28 the path of flanking movements, of reforms and
concessions to the non-proletarian classes—in order to disintegrate these
classes, to give the revolution a respite, to recuperate one’s forces and prepare the conditions for a new offensive. It cannot be denied that in a sense
this is a “reformist” path. But it must be borne in mind that there is a fundamental distinction here, which consists in the fact that in this case the
reform emanates from the proletarian power, it strengthens the proletarian
power, it procures for it a necessary respite, its purpose is to disintegrate,
not the revolution, but the non-proletarian classes.
Under such conditions a reform is thus transformed into its opposite.
The proletarian power is able to adopt such a policy because, and
only because, the sweep of the revolution in the preceding period was great
enough and therefore provided a sufficiently wide expanse within which
to retreat, substituting for offensive tactics the tactics of temporary retreat,
the tactics of flanking movements.
Thus, while formerly, under bourgeois rule, reforms were a by-product of revolution, now, under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the source
of reforms is the revolutionary gains of the proletariat, the reserves accumulated in the hands of the proletariat consisting of these gains.
“Only Marxism,” says Lenin, “has precisely and correctly defined the relation of reforms to revolution. However, Marx was able to see this relation only from one aspect,
namely, under the conditions preceding the first to any extent
permanent and lasting victory of the proletariat, if only in a
single country. Under those conditions, the basis of the proper
relation was: reforms are a by-product of the revolutionary
class struggle of the proletariat... After the victory of the proletariat, if only in a single country, something new enters into
the relation between reforms and revolution. In principle, it
is the same as before, but a change in form takes place, which
Marx himself could not foresee, but which can be appreciated
28. See V. I. Lenin, “The Importance of Gold Now and After the Complete Victory of
Socialism,” Works, 4th Russ. ed., Vol. 33, pp. 85-92.

only on the basis of the philosophy and politics of Marxism...
After the victory (while still remaining a ‘by-product’ on an
international scale) they29 are, in addition, for the country in
which victory has been achieved, a necessary and legitimate
respite in those cases when, after the utmost exertion of effort,
it becomes obvious that sufficient strength is lacking for the
revolutionary accomplishment of this or that transition. Victory creates such a ‘reserve of strength’ that it is possible to
hold out even in a forced retreat, to hold out both materially
and morally.” (See Vol. XXVII, pp. 84-85.)

8. The Party

Chapter VIII.

The Party
In the pre-revolutionary period, the period of more or less peaceful
development, when the parties of the Second International were the predominant force in the working-class movement and parliamentary forms
of struggle were regarded as the principal forms—under these conditions
the Party neither had nor could have had that great and decisive importance which it acquired afterwards, under conditions of open revolutionary clashes. Defending the Second International against attacks made
upon it, Kautsky says that the parties of the Second International are an
instrument of peace and not of war, and that for this very reason they were
powerless to take any important steps during the war, during the period of
revolutionary action by the proletariat. That is quite true. But what does
it mean? It means that the parties of the Second International are unfit for
the revolutionary struggle of the proletariat, that they are not militant parties of the proletariat, leading the workers to power, but election machines
adapted for parliamentary elections and parliamentary struggle. This, in
fact, explains why, in the days when the opportunists of the Second International were in the ascendancy, it was not the party but its parliamentary
group that was the chief political organisation of the proletariat. It is well
known that the party at that time was really an appendage and subsidiary
of the parliamentary group. It scarcely needs proof that under such circumstances and with such a party at the helm there could be no question
of preparing the proletariat for revolution.
But matters have changed radically with the dawn of the new period.
The new period is one of open class collisions, of revolutionary action by
the proletariat, of proletarian revolution, a period when forces are being
directly mustered for the overthrow of imperialism and the seizure of power
by the proletariat. In this period the proletariat is confronted with new
tasks, the tasks of reorganising all party work on new, revolutionary lines;
of educating the workers in the spirit of revolutionary struggle for power;
of preparing and moving up reserves; of establishing an alliance with the
proletarians of neighbouring countries; of establishing firm ties with the
87

The Foundations of Leninism

liberation movement in the colonies and dependent countries, etc., etc. To
think that these new tasks can be performed by the old Social-Democratic
parties, brought up as they were in the peaceful conditions of parliamentarism, is to doom oneself to hopeless despair, to inevitable defeat. If, with
such tasks to shoulder, the proletariat remained under the leadership of the
old parties, it would be completely unarmed. It scarcely needs proof that
the proletariat could not consent to such a state of affairs.
Hence the necessity for a new party, a militant party, a revolutionary
party, one bold enough to lead the proletarians in the struggle for power,
sufficiently experienced to find its bearings amidst the complex conditions
of a revolutionary situation, and sufficiently flexible to steer clear of all
submerged rocks in the path to its goal.
Without such a party it is useless even to think of overthrowing
imperialism, of achieving the dictatorship of the proletariat.
This new party is the party of Leninism.
What are the specific features of this new party?
1) The Party as the advanced detachment of the working class. The
Party must be, first of all, the advanced detachment of the working class.
The Party must absorb all the best elements of the working class, their
experience, their revolutionary spirit, their selfless devotion to the cause of
the proletariat. But in order that it may really be the advanced detachment,
the Party must be armed with revolutionary theory, with a knowledge of
the laws of the movement, with a knowledge of the laws of revolution.
Without this it will be incapable of directing the struggle of the proletariat, of leading the proletariat. The Party cannot be a real party if it limits
itself to registering what the masses of the working class feel and think, if it
drags at the tail of the spontaneous movement, if it is unable to overcome
the inertia and the political indifference of the spontaneous movement, if
it is unable to rise above the momentary interests of the proletariat, if it is
unable to raise the masses to the level of understanding the class interests
of the proletariat. The Party must stand at the head of the working class;
it must see farther than the working class; it must lead the proletariat,
and not drag at the tail of the spontaneous movement. The parties of the
Second International, which preach “khvostism,” are vehicles of bourgeois
policy, which condemns the proletariat to the role of a tool in the hands
of the bourgeoisie. Only a party which adopts the standpoint of advanced
88

8. The Party

detachment of the proletariat and is able to raise the masses to the level of
understanding the class interests of the proletariat—only such a party can
divert the working class from the path of trade unionism and convert it
into an independent political force.
The Party is the political leader of the working class.
I have already spoken of the difficulties of the struggle of the working class, of the complicated conditions of the struggle, of strategy and
tactics, of reserves and manoeuvring, of attack and retreat. These conditions are no less complicated, if not more so, than the conditions of war.
Who can see clearly in these conditions, who can give correct guidance to
the proletarian millions? No army at war can dispense with an experienced
General Staff if it does not want to be doomed to defeat. Is it not clear that
the proletariat can still less dispense with such a General Staff if it does not
want to allow itself to be devoured by its mortal enemies? But where is this
General Staff? Only the revolutionary party of the proletariat can serve as
this General Staff. The working class without a revolutionary party is an
army without a General Staff.
The Party is the General Staff of the proletariat.
But the Party cannot be only an advanced detachment. It must at the
same time be a detachment of the class, part of the class, closely bound up
with it by all the fibres of its being. The distinction between the advanced
detachment and the rest of the working class, between Party members and
non-Party people, cannot disappear until classes disappear; it will exist as
long as the ranks of the proletariat continue to be replenished with former
members of other classes, as long as the working class as a whole is not in
a position to rise to the level of the advanced detachment. But the Party
would cease to be a party if this distinction developed into a gap, if the
Party turned in on itself and became divorced from the non-Party masses.
The Party cannot lead the class if it is not connected with the non-Party
masses, if there is no bond between the Party and the non-Party masses, if
these masses do not accept its leadership, if the Party enjoys no moral and
political credit among the masses.
Recently two hundred thousand new members from the ranks of
the workers were admitted into our Party. The remarkable thing about this
is the fact that these people did not merely join the Party themselves, but
were rather sent there by all the rest of the non-Party workers, who took
89

The Foundations of Leninism

an active part in the admission of the new members, and without whose
approval no new member was accepted. This fact shows that the broad
masses of non-Party workers regard our Party as their Party, as a Party near
and dear to them, in whose expansion and consolidation they are vitally
interested and to whose leadership they voluntarily entrust their destiny.
It scarcely needs proof that without these intangible moral threads which
connect the Party with the non-Party masses, the Party could not have
become the decisive force of its class.
The Party is an inseparable part of the working class.
“We,” says Lenin, “are the Party of a class, and therefore
almost the whole class (and in times of war, in the period of civil
war, the whole class) should act under the leadership of our
Party, should adhere to our Party as closely as possible. But it
would be Manilovism30 and ‘khvostism’ to think that at any
time under capitalism almost the whole class, or the whole
class, would be able to rise to the level of consciousness and
activity of its advanced detachment, of its Social-Democratic
Party. No sensible Social-Democrat has ever yet doubted that
under capitalism even the trade union organisations (which
are more primitive and more comprehensible to the undeveloped strata) are unable to embrace almost the whole, or the
whole, working class. To forget the distinction between the
advanced detachment and the whole of the masses which gravitate towards it, to forget the constant duty of the advanced
detachment to raise ever wider strata to this most advanced
level, means merely to deceive oneself, to shut one’s eyes to the
immensity of our tasks, and to narrow down these tasks.” (See
Vol. VI, pp. 205-06.)
2) The Party as the organised detachment of the working class. The Party
is not only the advanced detachment of the working class. If it desires really
to direct the struggle of the class it must at the same time be the organised
30. Manilovism — smug complacency, futile daydreaming; from the landowner Manilov,
a character in Gogol’s Dead Souls.

90

8. The Party

detachment of its class. The Party’s tasks under the conditions of capitalism
are immense and extremely varied. The Party must direct the struggle of
the proletariat under the exceptionally difficult conditions of internal and
external development; it must lead the proletariat in the offensive when
the situation calls for an offensive; it must lead the proletariat so as to
escape the blow of a powerful enemy when the situation calls for retreat; it
must imbue the millions of unorganised non-Party workers with the spirit
of discipline and system in struggle, with the spirit of organisation and
endurance. But the Party can fulfil these tasks only if it is itself the embodiment of discipline and organisation, if it is itself the organised detachment
of the proletariat. Without these conditions there can be no question of
the Party really leading the vast masses of the proletariat.
The Party is the organised detachment of the working class.
The conception of the Party as an organised whole is embodied in
Lenin’s well-known formulation of the first paragraph of our Party Rules,
in which the Party is regarded as the sum total of its organisations, and the
Party member as a member of one of the organisations of the Party. The
Mensheviks, who objected to this formulation as early as 1903, proposed
to substitute for it a “system” of self-enrolment in the Party, a “system” of
conferring the “title” of Party member upon every “professor” and “highschool student,” upon every “sympathiser” and “striker” who supported
the Party in one way or another, but who did not join and did not want
to join any one of the Party organisations. It scarcely needs proof that had
this singular “system” become entrenched in our Party it would inevitably
have led to our Party becoming inundated with professors and high-school
students and to its degeneration into a loose, amorphous, disorganised
“formation,” lost in a sea of “sympathisers,” that would have obliterated
the dividing line between the Party and the class and would have upset the
Party’s task of raising the unorganised masses to the level of the advanced
detachment. Needless to say, under such an opportunist “system” our
Party would have been unable to fulfil the role of the organising core of
the working class in the course of our revolution.
“From the point of view of Comrade Martov,” says
Lenin, “the border-line of the Party remains quite indefinite,
for ‘every striker’ may ‘proclaim himself a Party member.’
91

The Foundations of Leninism

What is the use of this vagueness? A wide extension of the
‘title.’ Its harm is that it introduces a disorganising idea, the
confusing of class and Party.” (See Vol. VI, p. 211.)
But the Party is not merely the sum total of Party organisations. The
Party is at the same time a single system of these organisations, their formal
union into a single whole, with higher and lower leading bodies, with
subordination of the minority to the majority, with practical decisions
binding on all members of the Party. Without these conditions the Party
cannot be a single organised whole capable of exercising systematic and
organised leadership in the struggle of the working class.
“Formerly,” says Lenin, “our Party was not a formally
organised whole, but only the sum of separate groups, and
therefore no other relations except those of ideological influence were possible between these groups. Now we have
become an organised Party, and this implies the establishment
of authority, the transformation of the power of ideas into the
power of authority, the subordination of lower Party bodies to
higher Party bodies.” (See Vol. VI, p. 291.)
The principle of the minority submitting to the majority, the principle of directing Party work from a centre, not infrequently gives rise to
attacks on the part of wavering elements, to accusations of “bureaucracy,”
“formalism,” etc. It scarcely needs proof that systematic work by the Party
as one whole, and the directing of the struggle of the working class, would
be impossible without putting these principles into effect. Leninism in
questions of organisation is the unswerving application of these principles.
Lenin terms the fight against these principles “Russian nihilism” and “aristocratic anarchism,” which deserves to be ridiculed and swept aside.
Here is what Lenin says about these wavering elements in his book
One Step Forward:
“This aristocratic anarchism is particularly characteristic of the Russian nihilist. He thinks of the Party organisation as a monstrous ‘factory’; he regards the subordination of
92

8. The Party

the part to the whole and of the minority to the majority of
‘serfdom’..., division of labour under the direction of a centre
evokes from him a tragi-comical outcry against people being
transformed into ‘wheels and cogs’..., mention of the organisational rules of the Party calls forth a contemptuous grimace
and the disdainful... remark that one could very well dispense
with rules altogether.”
“It is clear, I think, that the cries about this celebrated
bureaucracy are just a screen for dissatisfaction with the personal composition of the central bodies, a fig leaf... You are a
bureaucrat because you were appointed by the congress not by
my will, but against it; you are a formalist because you rely on
the formal decisions of the congress, and not on my consent;
you are acting in a grossly mechanical way because you plead
the ‘mechanical’ majority at the Party Congress and pay no
heed to my wish to be co-opted; you are an autocrat because
you refuse to hand over the power to the old gang.”31 (See Vol.
VI, pp. 310, 287.)
3) The Party as the highest form of class organisation of the proletariat. The Party is the organised detachment of the working class. But the
Party is not the only organisation of the working class. The proletariat
has also a number of other organisations, without which it cannot wage
a successful struggle against capital: trade unions, co-operatives, factory
organisations, parliamentary groups, non-Party women’s associations, the
press, cultural and educational organisations, youth leagues, revolutionary
fighting organisations (in times of open revolutionary action), Soviets of
deputies as the form of state organisation (if the proletariat is in power),
etc. The overwhelming majority of these organisations are non-Party, and
only some of them adhere directly to the Party, or constitute offshoots
from it. All these organisations, under certain conditions, are absolutely
necessary for the working class, for without them it would be impossible
to consolidate the class positions of the proletariat in the diverse spheres
31. The “gang” here referred to is that of Axelrod, Martov, Potresov and others, who
would not submit to the decisions of the Second Congress and who accused Lenin of
being a “bureaucrat.”—J. St.

93

The Foundations of Leninism

of struggle; for without them it would be impossible to steel the proletariat as the force whose mission it is to replace the bourgeois order by the
socialist order. But how can single leadership be exercised with such an
abundance of organisations? What guarantee is there that this multiplicity
of organisations will not lead to divergency in leadership? It may be said
that each of these organisations carries on its work in its own special field,
and that therefore these organisations cannot hinder one another. That, of
course, is true. But it is also true that all these organisations should work
in one direction for they serve one class, the class of the proletarians. The
question then arises: who is to determine the line, the general direction,
along which the work of all these organisations is to be conducted? Where
is the central organisation which is not only able, because it has the necessary experience, to work out such a general line, but, in addition, is in a
position, because it has sufficient prestige, to induce all these organisations
to carry out this line, so as to attain unity of leadership and to make hitches
impossible?
That organisation is the Party of the proletariat.
The Party possesses all the necessary qualifications for this because,
in the first place, it is the rallying centre of the finest elements in the working class, who have direct connections with the non-Party organisations of
the proletariat and very frequently lead them; because, secondly, the Party,
as the rallying centre of the finest members of the working class, is the
best school for training leaders of the working class, capable of directing
every form of organisation of their class; because, thirdly, the Party, as the
best school for training leaders of the working class, is, by reason of its
experience and prestige, the only organisation capable of centralising the
leadership of the struggle of the proletariat, thus transforming each and
every non-Party organisation of the working class into an auxiliary body
and transmission belt linking the Party with the class.
The Party is the highest form of class organisation of the proletariat.
This does not mean, of course, that non-Party organisations, trade
unions, co-operatives, etc., should be officially subordinated to the Party
leadership. It only means that the members of the Party who belong to
these organisations and are doubtlessly influential in them should do all
they can to persuade these non-Party organisations to draw nearer to the
Party of the proletariat in their work and voluntarily accept its political
94

8. The Party

leadership.
That is why Lenin says that the Party is “the highest form of proletarian class association,” whose political leadership must extend to every
other form of organisation of the proletariat. (See Vol. XXV, p. 194.)
That is why the opportunist theory of the “independence” and “neutrality” of the non-Party organisations, which breeds independent members
of parliament and journalists isolated from the Party, narrow-minded trade
union leaders and philistine co-operative officials, is wholly incompatible
with the theory and practice of Leninism.
4) The Party as an instrument of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The
Party is the highest form of organisation of the proletariat. The Party is
the principal guiding force within the class of the proletarians and among
the organisations of that class. But it does not by any means follow from
this that the Party can be regarded as an end in itself, as a self-sufficient
force. The Party is not only the highest form of class association of the
proletarians; it is at the same time an instrument in the hands of the proletariat for achieving the dictatorship when that has not yet been achieved
and for consolidating and expanding the dictatorship when it has already
been achieved. The Party could not have risen so high in importance and
could not have exerted its influence over all other forms of organisation of
the proletariat, if the latter had not been confronted with the question of
power, if the conditions of imperialism, the inevitability of wars, and the
existence of a crisis had not demanded the concentration of all the forces
of the proletariat at one point, the gathering of all the threads of the revolutionary movement in one spot in order to overthrow the bourgeoisie
and to achieve the dictatorship of the proletariat. The proletariat needs the
Party first of all as its General Staff, which it must have for the successful seizure of power. It scarcely needs proof that without a party capable
of rallying around itself the mass organisations of the proletariat, and of
centralising the leadership of the entire movement during the progress of
the struggle, the proletariat in Russia could not have established its revolutionary dictatorship.
But the proletariat needs the Party not only to achieve the dictatorship; it needs it still more to maintain the dictatorship, to consolidate and
expand it in order to achieve the complete victory of socialism.
95

The Foundations of Leninism

“Certainly, almost everyone now realises,” says Lenin,
“that the Bolsheviks could not have maintained themselves
in power for two-and-a-half months, let alone two-and-a-half
years, without the strictest, truly iron discipline in our Party,
and without the fullest and unreserved support of the latter by
the whole mass of the working class, that is, by all its thinking, honest, self-sacrificing and influential elements, capable
of leading or of carrying with them the backward strata.” (See
Vol. XXV, p. 173.)
Now, what does to “maintain” and “expand” the dictatorship mean?
It means imbuing the millions of proletarians with the spirit of discipline
and organisation; it means creating among the proletarian masses a cementing force and a bulwark against the corrosive influences of the petty-bourgeois elemental forces and petty-bourgeois habits; it means enhancing the
organising work of the proletarians in re-educating and remoulding the
petty-bourgeois strata; it means helping the masses of the proletarians to
educate themselves as a force capable of abolishing classes and of preparing
the conditions for the organisation of socialist production. But it is impossible to accomplish all this without a party which is strong by reason of its
solidarity and discipline.
“The dictatorship of the proletariat,” says Lenin, “is a
stubborn struggle—bloody and bloodless, violent and peaceful, military and economic, educational and administrative—
against the forces and traditions of the old society. The force of
habit of millions and tens of millions is a most terrible force.
Without an iron party tempered in the struggle, without a
party enjoying the confidence of all that is honest in the given
class, without a party capable of watching and influencing the
mood of the masses, it is impossible to conduct such a struggle
successfully.” (See Vol. XXV, p. 190.)
The proletariat needs the Party for the purpose of achieving and
maintaining the dictatorship. The Party is an instrument of the dictatorship of the proletariat.
96

8. The Party

But from this it follows that when classes disappear and the dictatorship of the proletariat withers away, the Party also will wither away.
5) The Party as the embodiment of unity of will, unity incompatible
with the existence of factions. The achievement and maintenance of the dictatorship of the proletariat is impossible without a party which is strong
by reason of its solidarity and iron discipline. But iron discipline in the
Party is inconceivable without unity of will, without complete and absolute unity of action on the part of all members of the Party. This does not
mean, of course, that the possibility of conflicts of opinion within the Party
is thereby precluded. On the contrary, iron discipline does not preclude
but presupposes criticism and conflict of opinion within the Party. Least
of all does it mean that discipline must be “blind.” On the contrary, iron
discipline does not preclude but presupposes conscious and voluntary submission, for only conscious discipline can be truly iron discipline. But after
a conflict of opinion has been closed, after criticism has been exhausted
and a decision has been arrived at, unity of will and unity of action of all
Party members are the necessary conditions without which neither Party
unity nor iron discipline in the Party is conceivable.
“In the present epoch of acute civil war,” says Lenin,
“the Communist Party will be able to perform its duty only
if it is organised in the most centralised manner, if iron discipline bordering on military discipline prevails in it, and if
its Party centre is a powerful and authoritative organ, wielding wide powers and enjoying the universal confidence of the
members of the Party.” (See Vol. XXV, pp. 282-83.)
This is the position in regard to discipline in the Party in the period
of struggle preceding the achievement of the dictatorship.
The same, but to an even greater degree, must be said about discipline in the Party after the dictatorship has been achieved.
“Whoever,” says Lenin, “weakens in the least the iron
discipline of the Party of the proletariat (especially during the
time of its dictatorship), actually aids the bourgeoisie against
the proletariat.” (See Vol. XXV, p. 190.)
97

The Foundations of Leninism

But from this it follows that the existence of factions is compatible
neither with the Party’s unity nor with its iron discipline. It scarcely needs
proof that the existence of factions leads to the existence of a number of
centres, and the existence of a number of centres means the absence of one
common centre in the Party, the breaking up of unity of will, the weakening and disintegration of discipline, the weakening and disintegration of
the dictatorship. Of course, the parties of the Second International, which
are fighting against the dictatorship of the proletariat and have no desire
to lead the proletarians to power, can afford such liberalism as freedom of
factions, for they have no need at all for iron discipline. But the parties of
the Communist International, whose activities are conditioned by the task
of achieving and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, cannot
afford to be “liberal” or to permit freedom of factions.
The Party represents unity of will, which precludes all factionalism
and division of authority in the Party.
Hence Lenin’s warning about the “danger of factionalism from the
point of view of Party unity and of effecting the unity of will of the vanguard of the proletariat as the fundamental condition for the success of the
dictatorship of the proletariat,” which is embodied in the special resolution
of the Tenth Congress of our Party “On Party Unity.”32
Hence Lenin’s demand for the “complete elimination of all factionalism” and the “immediate dissolution of all groups, without exception, that
have been formed on the basis of various platforms,” on pain of “unconditional and immediate expulsion from the Party.” (See the resolution “On
Party Unity.”)
6) The Party becomes strong by purging itself of opportunist elements.
The source of factionalism in the Party is its opportunist elements. The
proletariat is not an isolated class. It is constantly replenished by the influx
of peasants, petty bourgeois and intellectuals proletarianised by the development of capitalism. At the same time the upper stratum of the proletariat, principally trade union leaders and members of parliament who are
fed by the bourgeoisie out of the super-profits extracted from the colonies,
32. The resolution “On Party Unity” was written by V. I. Lenin and adopted by the
Tenth Congress of the R.C.P. (B.), held on March 8-16, 1921. (See V. I. Lenin, Works,
4th Russ. ed., Vol. 32, pp. 217-21, and also Resolutions and Decisions of C.P.S.U. (B.)
Congresses, Conferences and Central Committee Plenums, Part I, 1941, pp. 364-66.)

98

8. The Party

is undergoing a process of decay. “This stratum of bourgeoisified workers,
or the ‘labour aristocracy,’” says Lenin, “who are quite philistine in their
mode of life, in the size of their earnings and in their entire outlook, is the
principal prop of the Second International, and, in our days, the principal
social (not military) prop of the bourgeoisie. For they are real agents of the
bourgeoisie in the working-class movement, the labour lieutenants of the
capitalist class..., real channels of reformism and chauvinism.” (See Vol.
XIX, p. 77.)
In one way or another, all these petty-bourgeois groups penetrate
into the Party and introduce into it the spirit of hesitancy and opportunism, the spirit of demoralisation and uncertainty. It is they, principally,
that constitute the source of factionalism and disintegration, the source of
disorganisation and disruption of the Party from within. To fight imperialism with such “allies” in one’s rear means to put oneself in the position of being caught between two fires, from the front and from the rear.
Therefore, ruthless struggle against such elements, their expulsion from
the Party, is a pre-requisite for the successful struggle against imperialism.
The theory of “defeating” opportunist elements by ideological struggle within the Party, the theory of “overcoming” these elements within the
confines of a single party, is a rotten and dangerous theory, which threatens to condemn the Party to paralysis and chronic infirmity, threatens to
make the Party a prey to opportunism, threatens to leave the proletariat
without a revolutionary party, threatens to deprive the proletariat of its
main weapon in the fight against imperialism. Our Party could not have
emerged on to the broad highway, it could not have seized power and
organised the dictatorship of the proletariat, it could not have emerged
victorious from the civil war, if it had had within its ranks people like
Martov and Dan, Potresov and Axelrod. Our Party succeeded in achieving
internal unity and unexampled cohesion of its ranks primarily because it
was able in good time to purge itself of the opportunist pollution, because
it was able to rid its ranks of the Liquidators and Mensheviks. Proletarian
parties develop and become strong by purging themselves of opportunists
and reformists, social-imperialists and social-chauvinists, social-patriots
and social-pacifists.
The Party becomes strong by purging itself of opportunist elements.
99

The Foundations of Leninism

“With reformists, Mensheviks, in our ranks,” says Lenin,
“it is impossible to be victorious in the proletarian revolution,
it is impossible to defend it. That is obvious in principle, and it
has been strikingly confirmed by the experience of both Russia
and Hungary... In Russia, difficult situations have arisen many
times, when the Soviet regime would most certainly have been
overthrown had Mensheviks, reformists and petty-bourgeois
democrats remained in our Party... in Italy, where, as is generally admitted, decisive battles between the proletariat and the
bourgeoisie for the possession of state power are imminent. At
such a moment it is not only absolutely necessary to remove
the Mensheviks, reformists, the Turatists from the Party, but it
may even be useful to remove excellent Communists who are
liable to waver, and who reveal a tendency to waver towards
‘unity’ with the reformists, to remove them from all responsible posts... On the eve of a revolution, and at a moment when
a most fierce struggle is being waged for its victory, the slightest wavering in the ranks of the Party may wreck everything,
frustrate the revolution, wrest the power from the hands of the
proletariat; for this power is not yet consolidated, the attack
upon it is still very strong. The desertion of wavering leaders
at such a time does not weaken but strengthens the Party, the
working-class movement and the revolution.” (See Vol. XXV,
pp. 462, 463, 464.)

9. Style in Work

Chapter IX.

Style in Work
I am not referring to literary style. What I have in mind is style in
work, that specific and peculiar feature in the practice of Leninism which
creates the special type of Leninist worker. Leninism is a school of theory
and practice which trains a special type of Party and state worker, creates a
special Leninist style in work.
What are the characteristic features of this style? What are its peculiarities?
It has two specific features:
a) Russian revolutionary sweep and
b) American efficiency.
The style of Leninism consists in combining these two specific features in Party and state work.
Russian revolutionary sweep is an antidote to inertia, routine, conservatism, mental stagnation and slavish submission to ancient traditions.
Russian revolutionary sweep is the life-giving force which stimulates
thought, impels things forward, breaks the past and opens up perspectives.
Without it no progress is possible.
But Russian revolutionary sweep has every chance of degenerating
in practice into empty “revolutionary” Manilovism if it is not combined
with American efficiency in work. Examples of this degeneration are only
too numerous. Who does not know the disease of “revolutionary” scheme
concocting and “revolutionary” plan drafting, which springs from the
belief in the power of decrees to arrange everything and re-make everything? A Russian writer, I. Ehrenburg, in his story The Percomman (The
Perfect Communist Man), has portrayed the type of a “Bolshevik” afflicted
with this disease, who set himself the task of finding a formula for the
ideally perfect man and... became “submerged” in this “work.” The story
contains a great exaggeration, but it certainly gives a correct likeness of the
disease. But no one, I think, has so ruthlessly and bitterly ridiculed those
afflicted with this disease as Lenin. Lenin stigmatised this morbid belief in
concocting schemes and in turning out decrees as “communist vainglory.”

The Foundations of Leninism

“Communist vainglory,” says Lenin, “means that a man,
who is a member of the Communist Party, and has not yet
been purged from it, imagines that he can solve all his problems by issuing communist decrees.” (See Vol. XXVII, pp.
50-51.)
Lenin usually contrasted hollow “revolutionary” phrasemongering
with plain everyday work, thus emphasising that “revolutionary” scheme
concocting is repugnant to the spirit and the letter of true Leninism.
“Fewer pompous phrases, more plain, everyday work...”
says Lenin.
“Less political fireworks and more attention to the simplest but vital... facts of communist construction...” (See Vol.
XXIV, pp. 343 and 335.)
American efficiency, on the other hand, is an antidote to “revolutionary” Manilovism and fantastic scheme concocting. American efficiency
is that indomitable force which neither knows nor recognises obstacles;
which with its business-like perseverance brushes aside all obstacles; which
continues at a task once started until it is finished, even if it is a minor task;
and without which serious constructive work is inconceivable.
But American efficiency has every chance of degenerating into narrow and unprincipled practicalism if it is not combined with Russian revolutionary sweep. Who has not heard of that disease of narrow empiricism
and unprincipled practicalism which has not infrequently caused certain
“Bolsheviks” to degenerate and to abandon the cause of the revolution? We
find a reflection of this peculiar disease in a story by B. Pilnyak, entitled The
Barren Year, which depicts types of Russian “Bolsheviks” of strong will and
practical determination who “function” very “energetically,” but without
vision, without knowing “what it is all about,” and who, therefore, stray
from the path of revolutionary work. No one has ridiculed this disease
of practicalism so incisively as Lenin. He branded it as “narrow-minded
empiricism” and “brainless practicalism.” He usually contrasted it with
vital revolutionary work and the necessity of having a revolutionary perspective in all our daily activities, thus emphasising that this unprincipled

practicalism is as repugnant to true Leninism as “revolutionary” scheme
concocting.
The combination of Russian revolutionary sweep with American
efficiency is the essence of Leninism in Party and state work.
This combination alone produces the finished type of Leninist
worker, the style of Leninism in work.
