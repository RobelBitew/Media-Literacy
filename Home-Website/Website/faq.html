                <h2>Media Literacy Tool FAQs</h2>
                <div class="faqs">
                    <h3>What is the target demographic?</h3>
                    <p><strong>Our target users are</strong> highschool students, college students or young adults. In our experience, these
                    users are more likely to get their news from social media rather than a traditional news channel or newspaper. Unlike news
                channels, which have biases depending on each station, social media creates a polarizing environment giving people more of what they
            constantly engage with-posts which are often also emotionally intense. This is more likely to only lead people to see more of what they agree
        with, rather than seeing the entire picture. </p>
                    <h3>What is the proposed solution?</h3>
                    <p><strong>Our proposed solution is</strong> to build a <strong>browser extension</strong> that overlays a UI popup on a social
                    media website like Facebook or Instagram when viewed in Google Chrome. We will use <strong>NLP</strong> tools to identify polarizing
                and emotionally overwhelming posts on social media. We will likely use JS and HTML. We may also add a website component that explains our tool
            and includes a positionality statement. The UI popup may describe emotion the post is attempting to elicit and the emotional intensity of a post.
        Additionally, we would like to display the likelihood that the given post contains polarizing, othering language, how similar the post is to other
    recent content you've viewed, and questions to foster critical thinking. We hope that users will stop to think more about whether they are reading
posts which are attempting to use divisive language or create animosity.</p>
                        <h3>What technology are we using?</h3>
                        <p><strong>The technology we will use:</strong> we will develop a chrome browser extension, possible using HTML and JS, and NLP libraries.</p>
