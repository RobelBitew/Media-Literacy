                <h2>What is the Media Literacy AI Tool?</h2>
                <div class="about">
                    <p>A recent Stanford study found that both Democrats and Republicans in 2020 were
                        more likely to believe a news story that matched their political party than 
                        believe a story that was actually true. The bias persisted across education levels,
                        analytic reasoning ability, and political party [1]. Additionally, people remembered fake
                        news stories better than real ones - no matter which side they supported. As the average
                        American teenager absorbs nearly 9 hours of media a day, excluding academic work [2], media
                        literacy is a critical component of democracy. <strong>Specifically, social media
                            may be cognitively overwhelmed, bombarded with misinformation and advertising-leading
                            to uncritical reposting of false or harmful information.
                        </strong>
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>We seek to improve</strong> media literacy and reduce polarization by developing a
                    browser extension that highlights the emotional rhetoric in social media posts, easing users' cognitive
                load while encouraging more informed and reflective engagement.</p>
                <p><strong>This project targets Sustainable Development Goal 16-Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions-and
                    Goal 4: Quality Education.
                </strong></p>
                </div>
                <h3>Importance of the problem</h3>
                <p><strong>This is an important problem because the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations (UNAOC)
                    upholds media literacy as a key to building peacekeeping initatives
                </strong> and preventing the spread of misinformation that leads to polarization and identity-based conflict around the
            globe [3]. This is important for global progress towards SDG 4 and SDG 16. <strong>Misinformation and
                identity-based conflict affects everyone</strong>, as all SDG goals rely on strong democracies and well-informed citizens. However,
                our project currently directly targets English speakers who use social media.
            </strong></p>
                <p>In an ever-increasing age of digital technology, the rise of misinformation has led to increasing polarization that 
                    insights conflict. As a measure for promoting sustainable global development and peace, it is important now more than ever that global
                    citizens are understanding the true meaning behind the posts that they are seeing on a daily basis.
